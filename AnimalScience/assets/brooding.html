       <h2>Brooding Management</h2>
           <p>Brooding is the art of caring for young chicks after hatching. It involves the provision of those factors that are necessary for the survival and rapid growth of the chick. Such factors include heat, light, humidity, ventilation, feed, water and disease control. In Nigeria and indeed most tropical countries, humidity and ventilation can be taken care of by means of properly designed housing, but heat light, feed and water have to be provided as necessary. During the first few weeks of the bird’s life (between 0 – 6 weeks) it is usually necessary to provide supplementary heat to keep the birds comfortable. This period is referred to as the brooding period. Basically there are two methods of brooding:</p>
         <dl>
              <dt>Natural Brooding</dt>
             <dd>This is the method whereby a broody hen takes care of the chicks she hatches, although she can also be made to adopt purchased day-old chicks. The local fowls are suitable for this purpose and some Rhode Island Red birds may occasionally be reliable. A good-sized broody hen can be given as many as 12 chicks in cool weather and up to 15 in the hot season. Natural brooding is only practiced when small numbers of chicks are reared. It is quite unsuitable for a commercial scale operation.</dd>
         <dt>Artificial Brooding</dt>
         <dd>This is brooding without the mother hen. It necessitates the use of equipment which provides conditions similar to those of the broody hen, such as adequate warmth, protection against harsh weather and predators. It also makes for proper feeding, watering and disease control. Artificial brooding is the best method for the commercial producer. It is advisable for the beginning poultry man to try his luck at brooding a small number of chicks. If he is successful, i.e. with less than four percent mortality up to eight weeks of age then he can go on to brood larger numbers.</dd>

              <h2>Facilities Required for Brooding and Rearing</h2>
                  <div data-role="collapsible-set" >
                  <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
                  <h2>Housing</h2>
                      <p>Houses for brooding should be such that they conserve heat to keep the room warm. Houses meant for young chicks should be located at least 50m (150ft) away from houses containing older birds in order to minimise the risk of transferring diseases from old to young stock. In constructing a house, it is important to note the following:</p>
                      <dl>
                      <dt>Foundation and Wall</dt>
                          <dd>A solid and strong foundation is necessary. Digging should be done to a depth of between 0.5 – 0.7m (1.5 – 2ft) or more depending on the nature of the soil. After digging, a layer of concrete should be poured in to a depth of about 10cm (4”). This will form the basement upon which the blocks will be laid. To minimize the effect of termites, an anti-termite chemical can be poured on top of this basement. For growers and broilers the wall should be half-open sided but for layers the solid wall may be anything between 1/3 – 1/2. If cages are to be used, the solid wall should only be 1/3 of total height to the caves. It is essential to plaster the inner walls. The open sided portion of the wall has to be screed with 1/2 –3/4” chicken wire mesh. The total height of the wall need not exceed 1.9m (6’) from the floor to the caves.</dd>
                          <dt>Roof</dt>
                          <dd>Roofing materials such as zinc and aluminum roofing sheets are good for poultry houses. Asbestos is best because it doesn’t absorb as much heat but it is very expensive. Thatch roofing should be discouraged because of maintenance problems, difficulty of clearing parasites from the house and fire hazards. It is important to provide a good roof overhang of about 0.9 (3ft). This is necessary to prevent rain draft from entering the house through the open sides of the wall. The roof overhang may be longer than this on the side of the building facing the rain bearing wind.</dd>
                          <dt>Doors</dt>
                          <dd>Doors should be wide enough not less than 0.9m (3ft). This is to facilitate easy movement of staff, equipment, birds and manure in and out of the house. A footbath of disinfectant is needed at the foot of each door. This may be built in at the doorstep or it may be a movable container.</dd>
                          <dt>Storage Space</dt>
                          <dd>Provision should be made in the house for storage space for  equipment, feeds and other items that have to be kept in the house. The size of such a space should be about one-tenth of the total size of the house.</dd>

                      </dl>
                  </div>
                      <div data-role="collapsible">
                      <h2>Equipment</h2>
                          <p>A number of equipment is needed for the supply of heat and light, feeding and watering, manure handling and egg handling. These can be made locally, or purchased from a poultry equipment dealer. Factors to consider when buying equipment are cost, durability and ease of handling.</p>
                          <dl>
                          <dt>Brooder Box</dt>
                              <dd>The use of brooder boxes is necessary to conserve heat within a limited area when lamps (kerosene or electric) are used as source of heat for brooding. Brooder boxes can be made from wood or metal or may be improvised from thick cardboard paper or wooden boxes. All brooder boxes should be constructed with holes at the top to provide for the escape of fumes especially when kerosene lamps are used. A space allowance of 7sq cm per chick under the brooder bow is adequate, i.e. a bow measuring 1.25 x 1.25m (4 x 4ft) is adequate for up to 400 chicks.</dd>
                              <dt>Source of Heat</dt>
                              <dd>Warmth is the most important requirement for the day old chicks once the environment becomes too cold they can easily die especially when reared in large numbers. Heat for brooding may be supplied through kerosene lanterns, electricity lamps, charcoal, gas brooders or hot water pipes. Whatever source is used for heating, it is essential to prevent it from direct contact with chicks, litter material and brooder boxes. Two to three kerosene lamps placed on the floor or two 100 watts bulbs hung at about 20 cm (8 – 10 inches) above the floor is sufficient to provide heat and light for up to 75 – 100 chicks. A recent report indicates that under Nigerian conditions brooding with kerosene lamps as heat source is much cheaper than other sources although it requires more care (Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 1985).</dd>
                              <dt>Feeding and Watering Troughs</dt>
                              <dd>These are used for feeding and watering the chicks. Feeders maybe longitudinal or conical in shape. A linear feeding space of 2.5 meters (8ft) is adequate for up to 100 chicks from 0 – 4 weeks of age for broilers and from 0 – 6 weeks for pullets. Such a feeder should be shallow, not more than 7.5cm (3 inches) deep and be placed on the floor. The feeding space should be doubled for broiler chicks from four – 10 weeks and for pullet chick six – 14 weeks. For this age and beyond, the feeder should be about 1.5cm (six inches) deep. This means that 100 chicks would require one 1.25cm (4ft) long feeder up to four – six weeks of age use three of such feeders up to 10 or 14 weeks of age. Beyond 14 weeks of age use three of such feeders per 100 pullets or layers. Feeders should be constructed with lips to minimize feed wastage and fitted with rollers at the open end to prevent chicks from jumping in and contaminating the feed with their faeces. Feeders may be metallic or wooden. Most water troughs are conical in shape. Two, four-litre capacity water troughs are adequate for up to 100 birds from day old to six weeks of age. They should be used. Two water troughs of 10 – 15 litre capacity may be used for 100 chickens up to 200 weeks and three of such water troughs should be provided for 100 birds during the laying period. Water troughs should not be too large since they will be too heavy and tend to waste water. Water troughs usually made of metal, glass or plastic materials. In general feeders and water troughs are often constructed in two standard sizes, one for chicks and the other for older chicken, the chick feeders and drinkers are used during the brooding period while the bigger sizes should replace these as soon as the birds outgrow them, usually between four – eight weeks of age, depending on whether they are broilers or pullets. The poultry keeper may find it convenient to improvise his own feeders and water troughs. The points to observe in such a case is that the feeders and water troughs should be designed to minimise feed or water wastage and to prevent chicks from jumping in to feed or water wastage and to prevent the chicks from jumping into feed or water and contaminating it. For water troughs there should be no leakage and it should be easy to wash.</dd>
                              <dt>Litter Materials</dt>
                              <dd>It is necessary to cover the floor of the brooder house with some dry, clean, coarse and absorbent material before putting in the chicks. Such materials is meant to absorb the moisture from water as spillage and chick droppings in such a way that the house is kept dry all the time. The most popularly used litter material is wood shavings, available from sawmills and carpenters’ sheds and usually given free. Other litter material include: chopped maize cobs, guinea-corn and millet husks, chopped rice straw, chopped fry grass, crushed groundnut shells and rice husks.</dd>
                              <dt>Miscellaneous Equipment</dt>
                              <dd>In addition to the list enumerated above, the poultry keeper would need things like buckets, brooms, shovels, wheelbarrow, feed scoops, chicken crates, ropes for hanging feeders, water tanks for water storage, egg laying nests, egg trays, weighing scale and for big operations, office space and equipment would also be needed. Other equipment may also be purchased depending on availability and need.</dd>

                      <h2>Buying Chicks</h2>
                          <p>Day old chicks should be purchased from a reliable hatchery in order tovobtain quality chicks, which are very healthy and have the geneticvproduction potential. Place your order well in advance (about six months) and remember to indicate the sex, strain and quantity required. Seek the advice of your nearest poultry/livestock extension officer on the choice of breed and the hatchery. Some poultry keepers might prefer to buy only starter pullets so that they do not have to brood the birds themselves. Starter pullets at point of lay chicken are not b eing produced commercially in this country but it is one form of poultry business that can be very profitable if there is good co-operation between the pullet rearer and the egg producer. Before buying starter pullets, be very such that the producer had done a good job of rearing by going through the records and by physical examination and weighing a sample of the birds to see whether they have attained recommended weights for the breed or variety at that age. It is very important to be fully prepared before you collect day old chicks. This will ensure that they are properly transported and received at the farm. This increases their survival rate during the brooding period.</p>

                              <p>Get the brooder house ready about three weeks before the chicks arrive. Work to be done include:</p>
                              <ul>
                              <li>Making necessary repairs to mend leaking roofs, repairing doors and plastering cracks in the walls.</li>
                              <li>Removal of old litter from the house already in use sweeping, thoroughly washing and disinfections of the house using a suitable disinfectant such as Izal, Dettol, Sanities or Milton.</li>
                                  <li>Feeding troughs and drinkers already in use should also be thoroughly washed and disinfected.</li>
                                  <li>Making sure that all the necessary equipment have been purchased and are in good working condition.</li>

                              <ol>
                              <li>Sweep the house and clean the equipment</li>
                                  <li>Put litter on the floor. If the floor is not cemented, put a layer of dry clean sand before putting the litter. Put the litter to a depth of about 7.5cm (three inches)</li>
                                  <li>Cover the litter material with rough brown paper or old newspapers. This is to prevent the chicks from eating fibrous materials while learning to eat. The paper may be removed after four days.</li>
                                  <li>Assemble all equipment with the brooder box in the middle and the feeders radiating from the source of heat should be distributed evenly under the brooder box. The water fountain may be set between the feeders but near the edge of the hover. The whole arrangement is then enclosed by a chick guard of cardboard per about 45cm (30 inches) high and about 1.5m (5ft) away from the brooder box. Blocks or any other suitable material can also be used. The purpose of the chick guard is to prevent the chicks from drifting too far away from the source of heat. The guard may be removed back a little every day and then completely removed after 10 days.</li>
                                  <li>Test all equipment to make sure that they are in proper working condition.</li>

                <h2>Brooding Management Practices</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Arrival of Chicks</h3>
                        <ol>
                        <li>About 6 hours before the chicks arrive, fill the drinkers with medicated water, put on the heat source to warm up the room and place feed in the feeders. Some feed may also be sprinkled on the used as feeders during the first week.</li>
                            <li>Transport the chicks as fast as possible from the hatchery to the farm with minimum disturbance and preferably during the cooler part of the day. Ensure that the chicks are adequately ventilated while in transit, e.g. the chicks should not be up inside the boot of a car while in transit.</li>
                            <li>Collect all relevant information about the chicks from the hatchery of purpose. Have they been vaccinated? Are there any special management practices to be observed? What is the anticipated growth or production potential?</li>
                            <li>As soon as the chicks arrive, count and put them immediately under the hover. Remove all deformed chicks. Teach the weak chicks to drink if chicks are transported over long distances by road, the addition of glucose (or sugar if glucose is not available) to the drinking water may help to increase their survival rate.</li>
                            <li>After putting down the chicks stay and watch them for the next one hour and observe how comfortable they are. If they spread under the hover, they are comfortable. If they huddle in the center lose to the source of heat they are cold. If the room is too hot, they will move from the source of heat and be pushing up against the chick guard. The heat supply should then be adjusted accordingly.</li>
                            <li>Chicks have a tendency to crowd around corners of the building especially when frightened or if they feel cold. Piling can lead to mortality. It is therefore advisable to round off any sharp or square corners of the house with boards, bricks or jute sacks in order to prevent piling.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <h3>Daily Activities</h3>
                    <ol>
                    <li>During the first week, inspect your flock as early as possible in the morning, as late as possible in the evenings and occasionally at other times to ensure that the birds are comfortable.</li>
                        <li>Remove any dead birds and dispose properly by burial or use of a disposal pit</li>
                        <li>Remove mould or contaminated feed and add fresh supply. Feeders should only be filled about half to two-thirds capacity in order to minimise feed wastage. They should also be placed in such a way that no bird has to walk more than 3.05m (10ft) to get feed or water.</li>
                        <li>Remove water troughs and wash properly before refilling with fresh clean water that is fit for human consumption. Use medicated water throughout the first week. The water should be changed again in the afternoon, if it becomes dirty or refilled any time it is empty. Water troughs may be raised on blocks to minimize contamination.</li>
                        <li>Remove wet litter and replace with fresh and dry litter materials.</li>
                        <li>When kerosene lanterns are used <ul><li>Fill them up only two-thirds full every morning and evening</li><li>Remove any accumulated soot</li><li>Trim the wick periodically in order to obtain uniform flame.</li></ul></li>
                        <li>Fill in the records. For small holders a hard covered notebook is adequate but for large units a number of forms with the appropriate columns is usually kept for each pan.</li>
                        <li>All corridors and storage spaces should be swept clean and all equipment not in use should be neatly packed in such storage spaces.</li>
                        <li>If abnormal signs are observed, such as decreased feed consumption, bloody faeces, descried activity or droopiness report immediately to your nearest livestock or veterinary officer. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Periodic Activities</h3>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Cull birds that are deformed, stunted or are manifesting lack of growth and poor productivity. This cuts down on the cost of feed and also increases the space allowance for the healthy birds.</li>
                        <li>Debeak the birds at three – five weeks old and between 15 – 17 weeks of age by cutting off about 1/3 of the upper and lower beaks. Electric debeaking at about three weeks of age give a more permanent debeaking than old scissors debeaking.</li>
                        <li>Deworm at eight weeks and thereafter as necessary depending on the incidence of re-infestation of the flock by worms.</li>
                        <li>Following the routine vaccination programme recommended for your area.</li>
                    </ol>

       <p>Broiler production should be an attractive enterprise for school projects and backyard poultry producers because of its fast rate of return. Within a school term of ten weeks, broiler can be raised from day old to market weight. For the beginning poultry farmer it offers the unique opportunity to acquire basic poultry management skills, which can then be extended to larger flocks and other forms of livestock farming enterprises. Well managed good quality broilers should be ready for market by eight weeks at which time they should be averaging 1.7 – 2 kg each.</p>

                    <dt>Housing</dt>
                        <dd>The most practical system for broiler management is the “All in” and “All out” method whereby chicks are brought into one house at day old and reared to slaughter weight. They are then removed at once; the house is cleansed, washed, disinfected and allowed to rest for not less than two weeks before a new set is brought in. housing designed for brooding only can be use during the cold months in the North but at other times the conventional open-sided houses can be used so long asthe recommendation for optimum brooding conditions are observed.</dd>
                        <dt>Equipment</dt>
                        <dd>The equipment for broiler production are as described under brooding management because the watering chore takes more time than other routines, it is advisable to install and automatic water system. Automatic watering only requires an overhead tank, a pump to deliver water into the tank and the automatic waterers. Once the tank is full, water fills the waterers naturally by the force of gravity. However, it is important to check the watering lines everyday to ensure that there are no blockages.

</dd>
                        <dt>Feeds and Feeding</dt>
                        <dd>Broiler feeds are high energy, high protein-containing feeds designed to promote rapid growth. There are two types of broiler feeds available commercially. The broiler starter which should be fed for the first one – five weeks and the broiler finisher should be fed from five weeks to finish. Although both feeds can have the same energy level (300 ME Kcals/kg of diet) the broiler starter should have a higher protein (23 percent) than the finisher (20 per cent). Studies by Olomu and Offiong (1980) have shown that good quality vegetation protein can be used as the sole source of protein in finishers but not in starters. Hence there is the need to ensure that broiler feeds contain a good quality to meet the indispensable amino acid requirements. Good quality feed is an absolute necessity for the successful production of broilers and other poultry.</dd>
                        <dd>Broilers are usually fed at libitum. The use of artificial lights to stimulate feeding day and night can increase feed intake and promote a more rapid growth. To make feed available all the time means that care must be taken to minimise feed wastage as this tends to increase with such liberal feeding practices. The amount of feed required to raise a set of broiler would depend on the quality of feed, the duration for which the broilers are kept and the amount of feed wastage. The consumption of starter mash should be between 1.5 – 2.0 kg/bird from 0 – five weeks, while the amount of broiler finisher should be between 3 – 4kg/bird. </dd>
                        <dt>Management Routines</dt>
                        <dd>Daily and periodic routines during brooding have already been described. However, broiler production had the following peculiarities: No de-worming is necessary. Check weights weekly by sampling about five per cent of the birds.</dd>

       <p>Pullets are young chickens that are grown to start laying eggs by the time they are 20 – 24 weeks old. The primary goal of the pullet grower is to produce a lean, large-framed pullet that will become an economical and profitable layer.

</p>
                <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
                <h2>Housing and Equipment</h2>
                    <dl>
                    <dt>Housing</dt>
                        <dd>Pullets like broilers are most often reared on deep litter floors. The discussion on housing under brooding is therefore relevant to pullet housing. However, it is important for the farmer to decide whether to have separate brooding and pullet rearing houses or use the same facility to brood, grow and lay. For ease of management, it is better to have a separate house for brooding and rearing. Since it takes four – five months to brood and grow pullets to point of lay, one brood and grow house can be used to produce pullets that will occupy three or four laying houses. For a farm that plans to produce eggs year round, the first set of pullets would be brought in January and be transferred into a laying house in April; the second set begins in April/May which would be transferred into a second laying house in August. The third would be started in August/September, which would be transferred into a third laying house December.</dd>
                        <dd>In order to produce pullets that will be economical and profitable layers, great care must be taken to provide the management that will enhance good body development without accumulating fat. It is therefore necessary for the pullet grower to periodically (two weeks intervals) monitors their growth and compares with acceptable growth standards for his breed. It is desirable that 80 per cent of birds weighed must weigh within 10 per cent of the mean weight of the sample because the uniformity of individual weights is just as important as the average flock weight. The sample should be a random selection of about 100 birds per house.</dd>
                        <dd>Delaying sexual maturity is often a desirable goal because this helps to reduce the number of small eggs/bird. Mortality rate from day old to 20 weeks should not exceed five – six percent.</dd>
                    <dt>Feeds and Feeding</dt>
                        <dd>There is a tendency to think that pullet feeding is not critical since rapid growth is not a priority; more so that delay in sexual maturity is often a desirable goal. This is an erroneous concept because a badly reared pullet can never be a good layer. Commercially, growers’ mash is the available feed for pullets from about eight weeks old to between 18 – 20 weeks of age. Chick mash would have been fed from 0 – eight weeks. However, the present trend worldwide is to have two types of pullet developer ratios, one to be fed from eight up to about 14 weeks and second from 14 weeks to point of lay. Table 2.4 gives the feed names and quantities per 100 birds based on the two feeding regimes with no feed restriction.</dd>
                        <dd><strong>Feeding Restriction: </strong>When pullets are full fed, they tend to mature early and may begin to lay from 18 weeks of age. Most of these eggs would be too small to fetch good prices. It has therefore become a common practice to restrict feeds for growing pullets the advantages of feed restriction are:</dd>

                    </dl>
                    <ol>
                    <li>It reduces the number of small eggs because the birds produce larger eggs soon after the commencement of lay</li>
                        <li>Trends to reduce laying house mortality</li>
                        <li>It often produces a bird with a larger frame and capacity at point of lay</li>
                        <li>May result in increased egg production</li>
                        <li>May produce significant savings in feed cost/pullet. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Feed restriction however, should be practiced only when sample weighing indicates that the birds are growing too rapidly. One of three methods can be used:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li><strong>Skip-a-day: </strong>Full feed for two days and then skip a day without feed. This is the easiest method and it also tends to be less harsh on the birds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Restrict total feed intake: </strong>Feed only about 80 per cent of the regular feed intake on a daily basis</li>
                        <li><strong>Restrict the intake of protein or energy: </strong>This method can be applied if the farmer mixes his own feeds or is custom mixed.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Although feed restriction is a good management practice for pullets it must be applied only if a definite need for it has been established. The fact is that most commercial grower mashes are already restricted in energy and protein, this means that further physical restriction of feed intake would lead to excessive feed restriction that will be harmful to the birds.
Precautionary measures necessary for effective application of feed restriction procedures include the following:
</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>a)	Be sure to have adequate feeder space, especially if daily physical feed restriction is adopted.</li>
                        <li>b)	Birds must be properly debeaked as there is a tendency towards increased incidence of cannibalism could be a serious threat.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <dl>
                    <dt>Debeaking (Beak-trimming): </dt>
                        <dd>This is very important pullet management practice which if properly done have the following advantages:</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Reduces mortality due to feather and vent pecking</li>
                        <li>Decreases egg pecking</li>
                        <li>Improves feed efficiency by decreasing feed wastage</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Early debeaking at six – 10 days is the most preferred because chicks are easier to handle than pullets, it prevents the cannibalistic habit at an early age, there is less interference with later vaccinations and there will be greater bird uniformity in the flock. Debeaking may also be done at four – six weeks and from 14 – 16 weeks. The debeaking process is a major stress factor regardless of the age of birds on which it is done. It is therefore important that it is done with cold scissors but this often leads to excessive bleeding and high mortality. The best method is to use an electric debeaker. The procedure for debeaking is summarised as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Mobilise a sufficient number of staff for holding the birds and trained personnel for debeaking</li>
                        <li>Work during the cooler periods of the day. If possible avoid debeaking during the hotter periods of the year</li>
                        <li>Work out a system for the most efficient and rapid handling of birds during the process</li>
                        <li>Cut between 1/2 to 1/3 of the upper and lower beaks, Cut sharply and cauterise properly to avoid excessive bleeding</li>
                        <li>Provide plenty of feed and water after debeaking</li>
                        <li>Use anti-stress feed or water additives for about three days after debeaking</li>
                        <li>Do not debeak birds that are already under some kind of stress e.g. vaccinations.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Moving Pullets into laying Houses</h3>
                    <p>The movement of pullets from a rearing house into laying facilities is a significant stress factor. Care must therefore be taken to ensure that the effect of such a stress is minimal. Movement should take place between 18 – 20 weeks old i.e. before the birds begin laying. This procedure should be followed:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Move birds during the cooler periods of the day, best of all in the evening</li>
                        <li>Get the laying facility fully supplied with feed and water prior to stocking. Use anti-stress feed or water additives</li>
                        <li>Eliminating feed 12 hours before moving may be helpful in decreasing pullet dehydration</li>
                        <li>Birds should be handled gently. Scratches or bruises can produce cage layer fatigue</li>
                        <li>Avoid overcrowding. Provide a minimum of 150 sq m. (2sq ft.) of space per bird in the laying house if deep litter is to be used.</li>
                    </ol>

       <p>Pullets fed liberally under good management conditions may begin to lay eggs anytime after 18 weeks of age. However, delaying sexual maturity is a common management practice, which often leads to hens coming into lay after twenty weeks of age. Good layers should attain 50% hen-day egg production by 26 weeks of age.

</p>
       <h3>Egg Production Goals</h3>
                <p>The profitability of any egg production enterprise depends largely on the number of eggs produced per laying hen. The primary goal of this enterprise is therefore to produce the maximum number of eggs at minimum cost. Under Nigerian conditions a good laying hen (medium sized brown eggers) should be able to produce about 220eggs/yr and consume an average of 120g of feed/day. Mortality rates should not exceed about one per cent every month. </p>
                <h3>Housing and Equipment</h3> 
                <p>The farmer is often faced with the dilemma of raising layers on deep litter floor or in cages. In both cases solid structures have to be erected, but if cages are to be installed additional expenses must be incurred in the flooring construction to provide for heavier concreting with deep pit. Both the deep litter floor and cage systems have their advantages and disadvantages.</p>        
          <h3>Feeds and Feeding</h3>
                <p>Layers mash may contain between 2400 – 2800 Kcals of ME/kg of diet and 16 – 17 per cent protein. The peculiarity of layer’s feed, however, is its high calcium content, which may be up to 3.5 per cent. The high calcium is necessary for laying down the eggshell.</p>
                <p>In recent years, phase feeding of layers has been advocated to be in line with the different phases of an egg production profile. The first phase start at point of lay to the period of peak production i.e. between 20 – 35weeks, the second phase begins at 35 weeks and ends at about 55weeks while the third lasts to the end of lay. Under such a system the ration for phase one should have 17 per cent protein, phase two 16 per cent and phase three 15 per cent protein. This takes cognizance of the differences in egg production during the three phases. The calcium level however, should be slightly increased from phase one to phase three to minimize egg breakage which normally increases with age of the hen. Feed and water should be given liberally.</p>
                 <h3>Management Guide for Layers</h3>
                <p>The following is a summary of management routines for laying hens:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Provide optimum space per bird. A space requirement of .186m (2sq ft) is adequate at point of lay</li>
                    <li>Introduce the pullets to layer’s mash preferably after the first eggs have been dropped (a production level of 2-5% )</li>
                    <li>Inspect birds daily for any signs of disease or abnormal behavior</li>
                    <li>Maintain accurate records of feed consumption, egg production and disease control measures. A sharp drop in feed consumption is often the first indicator of a pending disease outbreak or response to a major environmental stress.</li>
                    <li>Under hot weather conditions, provide plenty of cool drinking water, if possible, use artificial lights in the early mornings (from about 3:00 am) to stimulate feed consumption during the cooler times of the day.</li>
                    <li>Always enter the house courteously, rude entrance can create hysteria</li>
                    <li>Regularly cull unproductive birds. Removal of such hens creates more space for the remaining birds and saves on the feed cost that would have been expended on them. These birds may also fetch a better price at the time of culling than if they were left to be older before sale. All layers should be sold off after about one year of lay unless they are still economically productive</li>
                    <li>At the first signs of disease or any other problem, set up the preventive or corrective measures promptly</li>
                    <li>Prevent feed wastage.</li>

                <h3>Egg Collection and Handling</h3>
                <p>The chicken egg is one of God’s most wonderful creations. Inside it is a warehouse of nutrients in such a way that they can form a chick if the egg is fertile. This concoction of nutrients is held inside the shell, built in such a way that it is strong to bear the weight of a brooding hen but weak enough for the completely developed chick to break through at hatching time. The shell is also porous enough to allow gaseous exchange between the inside contents and the external atmosphere.</p>
                <p>This delicately designed bag of nutrients manufactured by the laying hen must be properly cared for if its original quality is to be retained during handling and storage. The conditions for handling and marketing of good quality eggs are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Provide adequate nests for hens of deep litter. The nest may have a hinged door at the top to facilitate easy collection of eggs</li>
                    <li>Keep litter dry. The egg is at its best at the point of oviposition. To prevent it from picking up dirt, the litter should be kept fresh by regular turning of the older litter, removal of wet spots and topping up with fresh dry litter when older litter becomes “caky” or too moist</li>
                    <li>Collect eggs at least three times a day. Frequently egg collection prevents the unnecessary accumulation and trampling of eggs by hens. The use of paper or plastic egg trays is best for egg collection because they make it possible to collect and stack eggs with minimum breakage.</li>
                    <li>Store eggs in a cool place. Egg quality deteriorates very rapidly in a hot environment. The optimum temperature for storing eggs is about 130 C (55.40F) at 75 – 80 per cent relative humidity.</li>
                    <li>Use the egg room only for eggs. Eggs should be kept away from onions, kerosene and other products with pungent odour that eggs might absorb.</li>
                    <li>During periods of egg glut, spraying or dipping eggs in minerals oil (groundnut oil, cotton seed oil or palm oil, etc.) for one minute will preserve egg quality under normal room storage conditions for about four weeks.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Selection and Culling</h3>
                <p>The selection and culling of unproductive hens from the flock has the following advantages:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>More floor space will be created for the good producers.</li>
                    <li>Saves on the feed cost of maintaining unproductive birds</li>
                    <li>Culling at an earlier age may fetch a better market price for the bird</li>
                    <li>May lead to a reduced incidence of diseases</li>
                    <li>It results in an improvement of feed efficiency for the entire flock.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Culling is a process that should actually begin at day old. Weak, diseased and unthrifty birds should continuously be culled out during the growing period. In laying flocks culling should commence soon after the hens attain peak production. The characteristics used to distinguish between good and bad layers are summarized in table below:</p>

       <h2>Battery Cage System</h2>
           <p>Most of the commercial layers today are kept in cages. This is particularly true in countries where the production processes are highly automated. The birds are easier to manage in cages.</p>
           <dl>
           <dt>Cage Types</dt>
               <dd>Many types of cages exist but the stair-step double decker type has become popular because unlike the vertical multi-stacked system, it does not require dropping boards or cleaning belts below the upper decks of cages. However, bird density per given volume house is lower for the stair-step cages compared to the stacked types. Cages should be placed in open-sided houses with dwarf walls. Under very hot conditions, the house may be no more than a roof over the cages.</dd>
               <dt>Stocking Density</dt>
               <dd>It has been proved that when caged birds are fewer in number, they tend to waste more feed. Results of many researchers conducted in the last decade with regards to how much we can crowd layers in cages have, however, indicated that crowding is more profitable only when egg prices are high and feed costs are low. Attaining high egg prices without corresponding increase in feed cost is very unlikely in this country.</dd>
               <dt>Manure Disposal</dt>
               <dd>Where small (backyard) or medium size farms are involved, manure accumulation may not pose many problems. The manure produced can be collected and spread on farmlands. This method is easy and less expensive. However, in large-scale operations consisting of thousands or millions of layers, and with land becoming scarce, manure disposal may become a serious problem. Lagoons, oxidation ditches, drying (dehydrating) and besides these methods being expensive, there is still the odour problem and/or the need for final disposal of the treated manure. Poultry manure can also be fed to animals, particularly ruminants, after it had been treated. Proper disposal of manure is necessary so that offensive odour do not accumulate and pollute the neighbourhood. Apart from constituting a nuisance to the birds themselves by attracting many flies, these odours and the flies make the working environment uncomfortable for the attendants.</dd>
               <dt>Cage-related Problems</dt>
               <dd>Layers kept in cages sometimes develop some problem whose specific causes have not been ascertained. Such problems are not common among layers managed on the floor. The main cage-related problems most commonly encountered are cage layer fatigue (birds are unable to stand due to weakened bones), fatty liver syndrome (lots of the oviduct to retract after laying) and egg drop syndrome. Stress may be involved in cage layer fatigue. However, it does not seem to have any adverse effect on egg production. The proper maintenance of automatic water troughs and feeders are critical. A block in the water line for example can lead to a sharp drop in egg production.</dd>

           <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
           <h2>Deep Litter Floor System</h2>
               <p>Install nests and fresh nesting material such as wood shavings, rice hulls or sawdust. Well designed nests should be provided to reduce time needed for caring for the laying flock and the eggs. Nests may be made of wood or metal and of varying arrangements, but should provide for convenience in egg collection. They may be placed in the middle of the pen or along the walls inside the building. Provide one nest measuring 30cm (12”) wide, 35cm (14”) high and about 30cm (12”) deep per 4 hens. For community nests should be cleaned regularly and new nesting materials added as needed to produce clean eggs.</p>
               <p>The litter should be stirred frequently and new materials added. Wet and “caked-over” spots should be removed and replaced with fresh, dry litter.</p>
               <p><i>A common problem with hens on deep litter is floor eggs. Eggs laid on the floor easily become dirty and are susceptible to breakage. The following management practices will help to ensure that the birds lay inside the nests rather than on the floor: </i></p>
               <ol>
               <li>Have nests in the laying house before the pullets are housed or introduced the nests before the pullets commence laying</li>
                   <li>Provide adequate, well-ventilated nests to prevent overcrowding</li>
                   <li>Round off corners of the house, which serve as nesting places</li>
                   <li>Close nests at nights</li>
                   <li>Provide nests with clean nesting materials</li>
                   <li>Use darkened nests and place them in darker sections of the house.</li>

                <h3>Management of Breeders</h3>
                <p>Breeders are essentially managed like layers except that management procedures must be more strictly adhered to. The following management practices must be given special attention.</p>
                <dl>
                <dt>Selection and Culling</dt>
                    <dd>Must be routinely and vigorously practiced.</dd>
                    <dt>Vaccination</dt>
                    <dd>There may be need for some vaccinations at point of lay which can serve to transfer immunity from hen to chicks e.g. IBD vaccine.</dd>
                    <dt>Feeding</dt>
                    <dd>Feeding breeder mash, which usually contain higher level of vitamins and some minerals than the regular layers mash. Feed restriction is often necessary for broiler breeder. A common practice is to limit feeding to only about 80 per cent of daily feed intake. Such diets must, however, be optimally fortified with minor nutrients.</dd>

       <p>Having outlined the consequences of heat stress to poultry, it is appropriate to discuss what can be done to combat heat stress. Both short and long term measures that have to be done immediately to cool down birds that are visibly suffering from heat stress. </p>
                <h3>Short-term measures that can be taken to combat heat stress</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>The use of artificial lights to stimulate nighttime feeding is perhaps the most advantageous method for combating heat stress. The minimum temperatures, which are usually recorded in the early morning, are within the range of ideal temperatures for laying hens throughout the year. Therefore if light is available, the birds will be able to maintain a high level of feed intake during the cool parts of the day.</li>
                    <li>However, during the hot afternoons when the risk of death from heat prostration is high, the provision of ice cooled water or spraying the birds with water from a garden hose are also practical considerations for alleviating heat stress.</li>
                    <li>The installation of electrically operated mechanical gadgets to improve ventilation or spray water in and around the poultry houses, are extensively used in many parts of the world. The most common of these gadgets is the fan. When placed on the windward side of the house, fans tend to increase the air speed as it blows through the building. At exceptionally high temperatures, it may be better to place the fans inside the house to blow the air lengthwise of the building.

</li>
                    <li>In some parts of the world, circulating micro jet sprinklers are installed at the point of the roof. Such sprinklers are used to spray the roof or the ground area around the poultry house with water. This aids in cooling the house and its surroundings. The installation of foggers which emit a fine mist of water that keep the chickens wet to aid in cooling the birds have also been utilized.</li>
                    <li>A short term measure to combat the effect of heat stress that is little known to poultry farmers is the manipulation of poultry feed formulas to provide feeds with lower energy content but adequately fortified with other essential nutrients. This practice is based on the principle that the amount of feed consumed by a bird depends on the energy requirement. For the poultry man who has control over his feed formula, it is recommended that during the hotter months of the year, feeds should be formulated to contain lower than usual energy levels but optimally fortified with other essential nutrients. Such diets should stimulate an increase in feed intake and consequently an increase in egg production for layers or growth rate for broilers. Related to this is the use of feed ingredients that contain fat. Where fats are economically available, they should be used as the preferred energy source for feed formulation because they are known to produce less specific heat than other sources of energy.</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Long-term measures that can be taken to combat heat stress</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Good housing design and construction is the most important long-term measure for combating heat stress. Nigeria is fortunate to be in a geographical region in which good poultry housing can be constructed at minimum costs. A good poultry house must provide the following necessities: protection from rain, sun, and pest, adequate ventilation, minimize ammonia build up and reduction in humidity. The design that best satisfies these requirements in most of the tropical world is an open sided house with a suitable roofing material. A house constructed with about two-thirds of its sidewalls open but screed with chicken wire mesh and less than 11m in width in most cases will have adequate natural ventilation for most of the year. Adequate ventilation is the most important factor for the control of ammonia build up, humidity and poultry house temperatures. The ideal poultry house should have an East-West orientation to prevent sunrays from entering the house and should be located on a well-drained site selected to take advantage of topographical features that favour free air movement in and out of the open-sided poultry houses. Other construction details of the ideal poultry house include the selection of economically suitable roofing materials that will produce a cooling effect in the house and floors and sidewalls that can easily be cleaned and disinfected. The use of gable roofing with ridges is increasingly being used as further means of enhancing adequate ventilation in poultry houses. The presence of trees around the houses can result in shades that will produce a cooling effect in the house environment.

       <p>As has often been said, prevention is better than cure. This is particularly necessary in poultry production where an outbreak of a disease can wipe out a whole flock. A much better and more practical way of dealing with disease is by prevention. It does not mean vaccination alone but constitutes a host of other practices, which must be followed regularly.</p>
                <dl>
                <dt>Cleanliness</dt>
                    <dd>This means that whatever the bird is given or made to come in contact with should always be clean. Regular use of disinfectants is important in controlling pathogenic microorganisms. The farm and its premises should be kept clean. It is also important that employees be provided with showers and clean clothing on the farm.</dd>
                    <dt>Pollution Control</dt>
                    <dd>Keep dust and offensive odour off the poultry house. Often, dusty air and bad odour are as a result of poor ventilation. Poor ventilation promotes rapid spread of respiratory diseases. </dd>
                    <dt>Dead Birds and Waste Disposal</dt>
                    <dd>Avoid throwing dead birds and refuse all over the farm premises. Dead birds should be properly disposed off. There are many ways of achieving this:</dd>
                </dl>
                <ul>
                <li>Incinerate (burn) in specially constructed facilities (incinerators) which when well operated are nearly odourless</li>
                    <li>Use plastic bags to hold the dead birds, seal and remove from the farm</li>
                    <li>Construct disposal pits in the ground into which dead birds are deposited for bacterial decomposition</li>
                    <li>Bury dead birds, deep enough to avoid being dug up by dogs, rats or other animals.</li>
                </ul>
                <dl>
                <dt>Consultation</dt>
                    <dd>Consultation with other farmers and poultry experts The “Lone Ranger” approach to poultry farming should be discouraged because more often than not, it is farmer who refuses to seek the advice and/or opinions of poultry experts and experienced and successful poultry farmers that runs into serious disease problems. Experts (poultry specialists, poultry pathologists and veterinarians) should be consulted at the beginning and regularly thereafter, for information on good source of day-old chicks, suitable housing designs, good management practices and recommendations that will ensure good performance from the birds. Consulting is a necessity for a beginner and should be important to those who have been in the business for a long time as is often the case, two heads are better than one.</dd>
                    <dt>Good Water and Feed Supply</dt>
                    <dd>Most sources of water (pipe borne, borehole or well water) often contain some impurities. Ideally, water supply to the farm should be tested for chemical contamination and purity. Avoid using nearby streams as source of water as chemical fishing upstream may render the water poisonous to birds. Adequate feeding is important for good health and productivity. Feeds fed should be well balanced so as to prevent occurrence of nutritional problems and to enable the bird withstand stress and disease attacks. Always inspect feeds for possible presence of decayed material, moldy grains, poisonous weeds and other possible sources of trouble.</dd>
                    <dt>Vaccination</dt>
                    <dd>Any poultry disease prevention strategy should involve a vaccination programme because the spread of some disease, particularly those of bacterial and viral origin is difficult to control even under the best management practices. Such diseases are therefore prevented by routinely vaccinating the birds. Just as there are many vaccines, so are there many vaccination programme.</dd>
                    <dt>Post Mortem Examination</dt>
                    <dd>This means finding out the cause of death of the bird. It involves physical examination and laboratory tests, and should be conducted by a trained person. Information from this exercise is important in changing or modifying your management practices in order to avert future occurrence of similar or other disease problems.</dd>
                    <dt>Control of External Parasite and Prdactors</dt>
                    <dd>The presence of external parasites on birds and rodents in poultry houses is a sign of poor management. These parasites irritate the birds and heavy infestation may cause heavy reduction in performance. The three main external parasites of poultry are lice, ticks and mites. They live within the feathers in all parts of the body and feed on the feathers or scales, while others bite or suck the blood of the host. Chemicals such as Malathion, carbaryl (Sevrin), Coumaphos, Rabon and Vetox can be used to control external parasites. Rodents (rats and mice) eat and destroy feeds and feed bags, transmit diseases and constitute a nuisance. Best control of rodents require general clean up and the use of baits such as warfarin, zinc phosphide, Epi Block and Havoc.</dd>
                    <dt>Other Preventive Measures</dt>
                    <dd>State with good quality chicks, do not mix birds of different ages and from different farms; restrict or prevent visitors into the poultry house; isolate sick birds as soon as discovered and seek veterinary attention; keep birds as comfortable as possible and avoid sudden changes in their environment which may cause stress.</dd>

       <p>Beside other uses, one of the purposes for keeping records on the farm is the information it provides on the health and health history of the flock. Veterinarians are often invited whenever there is a disease problem on the farm and they are expected to find the causes and correct them. To do this successfully, background information or the history of the flock is necessary. </p>
                <p>Certainly, it is difficult to provide such information correctly without records. There are different types of records, depending on the type of poultry enterprise. Irrespective of the type of production, farm records should provide information on medications, types of vaccines and how administered, feed consumption, mortality and cause. Records are essential as profit and loss indicators. They also help to identify disease problems at the very early stage when they can be more readily controlled. There are three records that must be kept by all poultry farmers.</p>
                <dl>
                <dt>Inventory</dt>
                    <dd>A list of all equipment, drugs feeds and other items in u se on the farm; date of purchase, cost and quantity of items should be appropriately kept.</dd>
                    <dt>Production Records</dt>
                    <dd>Should show date, status of birds; numbers, mortality, feed consumption, culls and in the case of layers egg production. It is usual to maintain a record sheet for each house of flock for daily recording. Weekly and monthly summaries should be made and used as a basis for evolving the appropriate operational management decisions.</dd>
                    <dt>Sales Record</dt>
                    <dd>Show total product sales (chicks, broilers, culls and eggs) and revenue collected. It is absolutely essential to use different people for maintaining the production and sales records. It is the responsibility of management to ensure that all eggs collected or birds produced are properly accounted for from day to day. The theft of birds, eggs, and other farm supplies by farm workers are commonplace so it is extremely important to have proper accountability.</dd>
