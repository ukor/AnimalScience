                 <p>Routine flock health management is very important in an intensive sheep production system if mortality is to be kept at a reasonably low level. Advice in this regard should be sought from the nearest veterinary department of the Ministry of Agriculture. Significant common diseases of ruminants in different parts of Nigeria are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>	South-west zone: PPR (or kata), pneumonias (viral and bacterial), trypanosomiasis, helminthiasis, coccidiosis, bacterial infections and ectoparasites.
        </li>
        <li>	South-east zone: PPR, pneumonias, trypanosomiasis, helminthiasis, ectoparasites, bacterial diseases and coccidiosis.
</li>
            <li>Northern zone: pneumonias, trypanosomiasis, helminthiasis, ectoparasites, bacterial diseases, ectoparasites, skin disorders and coccidiosis</li>

        </ul>
        <p>The most basic health precautions are provision of adequate nutrition and maintenance of pen hygiene. Animals on low plane of nutrition are more susceptible to diseases than well-fed ones. Sheep pens should be cleaned at least once a month and periodically disinfected.
Overcrowding should be avoided. Sick animals should be transferred to a sick or isolation pen for proper veterinary care to reduce chances of infecting other animals. Newly purchased animals should be properly quarantined before introduction into the main flock.
PPR, which is a major disease especially in the southern parts of the country can effectively be controlled though vaccination. Helminthiasis and ectoparasites can be controlled by routine deworming and tick baths. Their importance varies from farm to farm depending on grazing management as well as between seasons. These diseases are more prevalent in the rainy season. Routine deworming with anthelmintics and tick-baths with acaricides should be carried out once in three months during the dry season depending on the severity of the problem.
The farmer should ensure that lambs receive colostrums from their dams after birth. The navels of newly born lambs should be swabbed with iodine tincture. Coccidiosis tends to become a problem in newly weaned lambs and should be treated against as advised by a veterinarian. 
</p>
        <p>Generally, it is good practice to do the following:</p>
        <ol><li>External parasites control measures.</li>
<li>Observe the flock closely early in the morning and at other times for early detection of sick animals</li>
<li>Isolate sick animal and seek prompt veterinary attention for diagnosis and treatment.</li>
<li>	Keep proper health records and have animals that died autopsied.</li>
<li> Keep newly purchased animal under for 30 days if possible before introduction into the main flock</li>
<li>	 Provide mineral salt licks and clean water in pens always.</li>
<li>	Ensure that animals are receiving adequate and balanced ration.</li>
<li>Where pastures have been established rotational system of grazing between paddocks should be enforced to avoid build up of parasites on pastures.</li>
<li> Trim hooves and horns when necessary.</li>
</ol>
        <h3>2.3.4 Feed Lot Fattening of Rams</h3>
        <p>A major attraction of intensive sheep production is the opportunity it offers for large scale production of rams especially for sale during festivals when they can be sold at very high prices. Before â€˜rushing into the business however, there is need for careful planning if the venture is not to fail. Important points to consider include source of rams, healthcare, housing, feeding and the market. All these must be properly taken care of.

Rams for fattening can come from the farm flock or may be purchased on the open market at a time when prices are relatively low. For best results rams should be fattened for 3 to 4 months before sale. The buying periods can be timed accordingly. In particular a festival ram should have well grown horns and be free from any deformities which may affect its subsequent market value. The rams should be between 1 and 4 years old. There is generally a good market for large grown animal. Avoid very young and very old animals.
After purchases, the rams should be quarantined during which time they should be de-wormed, given tick bath and treated against coccidiosis.

Feed supplies and feeding practice considerably influence the weight gains of animals and consequently the profit margin. Therefore it is essential to feed animals adequately both in terms of quality. Feedlot
rams should be fed good quality grass or legume hay at daily rates of 1 to 2.5 kg, depending on size of ram and type of hay, plus 0.2 to 0.5 kg of a concentrate mixture. Three examples of suitable fattening concentrate rations for sheep are as follows:
</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Maize 25%</p>
<p>Cottonseed cake 25%</p>
<p>Wheat offal 30%</p>
<p>Brewers dried grains 20%</p>
</li>
            <li>
            <p>	Wheat offal 40%</p>
<p>Cottonseed cake 25%</p>
<p>Brewers dried grains 25%</p>
<p>Molasses 10%</p>

            </li>
            <li><p>	Wheat offal 35%</p>
<p>Palm kernel cake 30%</p>
<p>Brewers dried grains 25%</p>
<p>Molasses 10%</p>
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where labour costs are low rations may be given in equal installments two or three times daily otherwise the rations can be fed ad libitum. Where rams for fattening are to come from the farm flock weaned lambs should be kept in groups and fed high quality chopped hay (preferably legume) ad labium until they weigh above 20 kg each thereafter they should be transferred to the feedlot pen and fed as described above. Feedlot rams should be washed with soap and groomed to make them more attractive to buyers, about four days before sale.</p>
