            <p>Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. They are responsible for thousands of 
                metabolic processes that sustain life. Enzymes are highly selective catalysts, greatly 
                accelerating both the rate and specificity of metabolic chemical reactions, from the 
                digestion of food to the synthesis of DNA. Most enzymes are proteins, although some 
                catalytic RNA molecules have been identified. Enzymes adopt a specific 
                three-dimensional structure, and may employ organic (e.g. biotin) and 
                inorganic (e.g. magnesium ion) cofactors to assist in catalysis.</p>
            <p>Enzymes act by converting starting molecules (substrates) into different molecules (products). 
                Almost all chemical reactions in a biological cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates 
                sufficient for life. Since enzymes are selective for their substrates and speed up only a 
                few reactions from among many possibilities, the set of enzymes made in a cell determines 
                which metabolic pathways occur in that cell, tissue and organ. 
                Organelles are also differentially enriched in sets of enzymes to compartmentalize 
                function within the cell.</p>
                <p>Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the rate of a reaction by lowering 
                    its activation energy (Ea‡). As a result, products are formed faster and 
                    reactions reach their equilibrium state more rapidly. 
                    Most enzyme reaction rates are millions of times faster than those of 
                    comparable un-catalyzed reactions and some are so fast that they are 
                    diffusion limited. As with all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by 
                    the reactions they catalyze, nor do they alter the equilibrium of 
                    these reactions. However, enzymes do differ from most other catalysts 
                    in that they are highly specific for their substrates. 
                    Enzymes are known to catalyze about 4,000 biochemical reactions. 
                    A few RNA molecules called ribozymes also catalyze reactions, with 
                    an important example being some parts of the ribosome.  
                    Synthetic molecules called artificial enzymes also display 
                    enzyme-like catalysis.</p>
                <p>Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: 
                    decreased by inhibitors or increased by activators. 
                    Many drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. 
                    Activity is also affected by temperature, pressure, chemical 
                    environment (e.g., pH), and the concentration of substrate. 
                    Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of 
                    antibiotics. In addition, some household products use enzymes to 
                    speed up biochemical reactions (e.g., enzymes in biological washing 
                    powders break down protein or fat stains on clothes; 
                    enzymes in meat tenderizers break down proteins into 
                    smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew). 
                    The study of enzymes is called

            <p>Enzymes are in general globular proteins and range from just 62 amino acid 
                residues in size, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, 
                to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase. A small number 
                of RNA-based biological catalysts exist, with the most common being the 
                ribosome; these are referred to as either RNA-enzymes or ribozymes. 
                The activities of enzymes are determined by their three-dimensional 
                structure. However, although structure does determine function, 
                predicting a novel enzyme's activity just from its 
                structure is a very difficult problem that has not yet been solved.</p>
             <p>Most enzymes are much larger than the substrates they act on, and only a 
                 small portion of the enzyme (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly 
                 involved in catalysis. The region that contains these catalytic 
                 residues, binds the substrate, and then carries out the reaction 
                 is known as the active site. Enzymes can also contain sites that 
                 bind cofactors, which are needed for catalysis. Some enzymes also 
                 have binding sites for small molecules, which are often direct or 
                 indirect products or substrates of the reaction catalyzed. 
                 This binding can serve to increase or decrease 
                 the enzyme's activity, providing a means for feedback regulation.</p>
                <p>Like all proteins, enzymes are long, linear chains of amino acids 
                    that fold to produce a three-dimensional product. Each unique 
                    amino acid sequence produces a specific structure, which has 
                    unique properties. Individual protein chains may sometimes group 
                    together to form a protein complex. Most enzymes can be 
                    denatured—that is, unfolded and inactivated—by heating or 
                    chemical denaturants, which disrupt the three-dimensional structure 
                    of the protein. Depending 
                    on the enzyme, denaturation may be reversible or irreversible.</p>
                <p>Structures of enzymes with substrates or substrate 
                    analogs during a reaction 
                    may be obtained using Time resolved crystallography methods.</p>

                <h2>Mechanisms</h2>
                    <p>Enzymes can act in several ways, all of which lower ΔG‡ (Gibbs energy):</p>
                    <ol data-role="listview">
                    <li><p>Lowering the activation energy by creating an environment in which the <br>
                        transition state is stabilized (e.g. straining the shape of a substrate—by binding <br>
                        the transition-state conformation of the substrate/product molecules, the enzyme distorts <br>
                        the bound substrate(s) into their transition state form, thereby reducing <br>the amount of energy required to complete the transition).</p></li>
                        <li><p>Lowering the energy of the transition state, but without<br> 
                            distorting the substrate, by creating an environment with <br>
                            the opposite charge distribution to 
                            that of the transition state.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Providing an alternative pathway. For example, temporarily <br>
                            reacting with 
                            the substrate to form an intermediate ES complex,<br>
                             this would be impossible in the absence of the enzyme.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Reducing the reaction entropy change by bringing substrates together <br>
                            in the correct orientation to react. Considering ΔH‡ alone overlooks this effect.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Increases in temperatures speed up reactions. Thus, temperature increases help<br> 
                            the enzyme function and develop the end product even faster.<br>
                             However, if heated too much, the enzyme's shape deteriorates and the<br>
                             enzyme becomes denatured. Some enzymes like thermo labile enzymes work<br>
                             best at low temperatures.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The function of a protein is dependent on its structure so that if the structure<br>
                             is disrupted, so is its function.</p></li>
                        <li><p>It is interesting that this entropic effect involves destabilization of the <br>
                            ground state, and its contribution to catalysis is relatively small.</p></li>
                    </ol>

                    <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
                    <h2>Specificity</h2>
                        <p>Enzymes are usually very specific as to which reactions they catalyze and the
                             substrates that are involved in these reactions. Complementary shape, charge and 
                            hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics of enzymes and substrates are responsible 
                            for this specificity. Enzymes can also show impressive levels of stereospecificity, 
                            regioselectivity and chemoselectivity.</p>
                        <p>Some of the enzymes showing the highest specificity and accuracy are 
                            involved in the copying and expression of the genome. 
                            These enzymes have "proof-reading" mechanisms. Here, an enzyme such 
                            as DNA polymerase catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then 
                            checks that the product is correct in a second step. This two-step 
                            process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 
                            100 million reactions in high-fidelity mammalian polymerases. 
                            Similar proofreading 
                            mechanisms are also found in RNA polymerase, aminoacyl tRNA 
                            synthetases and ribosomes.</p>
                        <p>Whereas some enzymes have broad-specificity, as they can act on a 
                            relatively broad range of different physiologically relevant 
                            substrates, many enzymes possess small side activities which 
                            arose fortuitously (i.e. neutrally), which may be the starting point 
                            for the evolutionary selection of a new function; this phenomenon 
                            is known as enzyme promiscuity.</p>

                    <h2>Lock and Key Model</h2>
                        <p>This is the simplest model to represent how an enzyme works. 
                            The substrate simply fits into the active 
                            site to form a reaction intermediate.</p>

                    <h2>Induced Fit Hypothesis</h2>
                        <p>In this model the enzyme molecule changes shape as the substrate 
                            molecules gets close. The change in shape is 'induced' by the 
                            approaching substrate molecule. This more sophisticated 
                            model relies on the fact that molecules are flexible because 
                            single covalent bonds are free to rotate.</p>

            <p>Some enzymes do not need any additional components to show full activity. 
                However, others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be 
                bound for activity. Cofactors can either be <br>
                <b><i>inorganic</i></b> <i>(e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters)</i>
                 or <br>
<b><i>organic compounds</i></b> <i>(e.g., flavin and heme).</i> 
</p>
                <p>Organic cofactors can be either <b><i>prosthetic groups,</i></b> 
                    <i>which are tightly 
                    bound to an enzyme</i>, or <i><b>coenzymes,</b> which are released from the 
                    enzyme's active site during the reaction.</i> Coenzymes include NADH, 
                    NADPH and adenosine triphosphate(ATP). These molecules transfer 
                    chemical groups between enzymes.</p>
                <p>These tightly bound molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. 
                    For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in 
                    redox reactions.</p>
                <p>Enzymes that require a cofactor but do not have one bound are called 
                    apoenzymes or apoproteins. An apoenzyme together with its cofactor(s) 
                    is called a holoenzyme (this is the active form). 
                    Most cofactors are not covalently attached to an enzyme, 
                    but are very tightly bound. However, organic prosthetic groups 
                    can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in the enzyme pyruvate 
                    carboxylase). The term "holoenzyme" can also be applied to 
                    enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as 
                    the DNA polymerases; 
                    here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the 
                    subunits needed for activity.</p>
                <div data-role="collapsible" id="coenzymes" class="ui-mini" data-collapsed="false">
                <h2>Coenzymes</h2>
                    <p>Coenzymes are small organic molecules that can be loosely or tightly bound 
                        to an enzyme. Tightly bound coenzymes can be called prosthetic groups. 
                        Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. 
                        Some of these chemicals such as riboflavin, thiamine and folic acid are 
                        vitamins (compounds that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be 
                        acquired from the diet). The chemical groups carried include the hydride 
                        ion (H-) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine 
                        triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or 
                        methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by 
                        S-adenosylmethionine.</p>
                    <p>Since coenzymes are chemically changed as a consequence of enzyme action, 
                        it is useful to consider coenzymes to be a special class of 
                        substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many 
                        different enzymes. For example, about 700 enzymes are known to 
                        use the coenzyme NADH.</p>
                    <p>Coenzymes are usually continuously regenerated and their concentrations 
                        maintained at a steady level inside the cell: for example, NADPH 
                        is regenerated through the pentose phosphate pathway and 
                        S-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. 
                        This continuous regeneration means that even small amounts of 
                        coenzymes are used very intensively. For example, the human 
                        body turns over its own weight in ATP each day.</p>

            <p>As all catalysts, enzymes do not alter the position of the chemical 
                equilibrium of the reaction. Usually, in the presence of an enzyme, 
                the reaction runs in the same direction as it would without the enzyme, 
                just more quickly. However, in the absence of the enzyme, other possible 
                uncatalyzed, "spontaneous" reactions might lead to different products, 
                because in those conditions this different product is formed faster. 
                <img alt="thermo" src="thermody.png"></p>
                <p>Furthermore, enzymes can couple two or more reactions, 
                    so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to 
                    "drive" a thermodynamically unfavorable one. For example, the 
                    hydrolysis of ATP is often used to drive other chemical reactions.</p>
                <p>Enzymes catalyze the forward and backward reactions equally. 
                    They do not alter the equilibrium itself, but only the speed at 
                    which it is reached. For example, carbonic anhydrase catalyzes 
                    its reaction in either direction depending on the concentration 
                    of its reactants.  <img alt="thermodynamics" src="themo.png"></p>
                <p>Nevertheless, if the equilibrium is greatly displaced in one direction, 
                    that is, in a very exergonic reaction, the reaction is in effect 
                    irreversible. Under these conditions, the enzyme will, in fact, 
                    catalyze the reaction only in the thermodynamically allowed 
                    direction.</p>

                Enzyme kinetics is the investigation of how enzymes bind substrates and turn them into products. 
                The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from 
                enzyme assays,  the dynamics of many enzymes are studied on the 
                level of individual molecules.</p>
                <p>Enzymes reaction are considered in two stages:</p>
                <p><i>In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to 
                    the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. 
                    This is sometimes called the Michaelis complex. 
                    The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in 
                    the reaction and releases the product. Note 
                    that the simple Michaelis Menten mechanism for 
                    the enzymatic activity is considered today a basic 
                    idea, where many examples show that the enzymatic 
                    activity involves structural dynamics. 
                    This is incorporated in the enzymatic mechanism 
                    while introducing several Michaelis Menten pathways 
                    that are connected with fluctuating rates.</i></p>
                <p><i>Enzyme rates depend on solution conditions and substrate concentration. 
                    Conditions that denature the protein abolish enzyme activity, such as 
                    high temperatures, extremes of pH or high salt concentrations, while 
                    raising substrate concentration tends to increase activity when [S] 
                    is low. To find the maximum speed of an enzymatic reaction, the 
                    substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product 
                    formation is seen. This is shown in the saturation curve on the right.
                     Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, 
                    more and more of the free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound
                     ES form. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the 
                    enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES 
                    complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme. However, Vmax 
                    is only one kinetic constant of enzymes. The amount of substrate 
                    needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. 
                    This is given by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the 
                    substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half 
                    its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a 
                    characteristic Km for a given substrate. Another useful constant is 
                    kcat, which is the rate of product formation handled by one active 
                    site and is generally given in units of inverse seconds.</i></p>
                <img alt="kinetics2" src="kinetics2.png">
                <p><i>The efficiency of an enzyme can be expressed in terms of kcat/Km. 
                    This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the 
                    rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including 
                    the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant 
                    reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for 
                    comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme 
                    with different substrates.</i></p>

            <p><i>An enzyme inhibitor is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and 
                decreases its activity.</i> Since blocking an enzyme's activity 
                can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many 
                drugs are enzyme inhibitors. They are also used as herbicides 
                and pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; 
                enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, 
                while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal 
                catalytic cycle of the enzyme.</p>
                <p>The binding of an inhibitor can stop a substrate from entering the enzyme's 
                    active site and/or hinder the enzyme from catalyzing its reaction. 
                    Inhibitor binding is either reversible or irreversible. Irreversible 
                    inhibitors usually react with the enzyme and change it chemically 
                    (e.g. via covalent bond formation). These inhibitors modify key amino 
                    acid residues needed for enzymatic activity. In contrast, reversible 
                    inhibitors bind non-covalently and different types of inhibition are 
                    produced depending on whether these inhibitors bind to the enzyme, 
                    the enzyme-substrate complex, or both.</p>
                <p>Enzymes inhibition are of two main types and they include:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Reversible inhibitors; and</li>
                        <li>Irreversible inhibitors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
<div data-role="collapsible-set">
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false" class="ui-mini">
    <h2>Reversible Inhibitors</h2>
        <p>Reversible inhibitors attach to enzymes with non-covalent interactions 
            such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds. 
            Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine 
            to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and 
            irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors generally do not undergo 
            chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by 
            dilution or dialysis.</p>
        <p>There are four kinds of reversible enzyme inhibitors. 
            They are classified according to the effect of varying 
            the concentration of the enzyme's substrate on the inhibitor.</p>
        <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
        <h2>Competitive Inhibition</h2>
            <p>In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor and substrate compete for 
                the enzyme (i.e., they can not bind at the same time). 
                Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate 
                of the enzyme. For example, methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor 
                of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction 
                of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the 
                structures of folic acid and this drug are shown in the figure to 
                the right bottom. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site 
                other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an 
                allosteric effect to change the shape of the usual binding-site. 
                For example, strychnine acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the 
                glycine receptor in the mammalian spinal cord and brain stem. 
                Glycine is a major post-synaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter 
                with a specific receptor site. Strychnine binds to an alternate 
                site that reduces the affinity of the glycine receptor for glycine, 
                resulting in convulsions due to lessened inhibition by the glycine. 
                In competitive inhibition the maximal rate of the reaction is not changed, 
                but higher substrate concentrations are required to reach a given maximum 
                rate, increasing the apparent Km.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
        <h2>Uncompetitive Inhibition</h2>
            <p>In uncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor cannot bind to the 
                free enzyme, only to the ES-complex. The EIS-complex thus 
                formed is enzymatically inactive. This type of inhibition 
                is rare, but may occur in multimeric enzymes.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
        <h2>Non-competitive Inhibition</h2>
            <p>Non-competitive inhibitors can bind to the enzyme at the binding 
                site at the same time as the substrate, but not to the active site. 
                Both the EI and EIS complexes are enzymatically inactive. 
                Because the inhibitor cannot be driven from the enzyme by higher 
                substrate concentration (in contrast to competitive inhibition), 
                the apparent Vmax changes. But because the substrate can still bind 
                to the enzyme, the Km stays the same.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
        <h2>Mixed Inhibition</h2>
            <p>This type of inhibition resembles the non-competitive, except that the
                 EIS-complex has residual enzymatic activity.This type of inhibitor 
                does not follow Michaelis-Menten equation.</p>
<p>In many organisms, inhibitors may act as part of a feedback mechanism. 
    If an enzyme produces too much of one substance in the organism, 
    that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme at the beginning 
    of the pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to 
    slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of negative 
    feedback. Enzymes that are subject to this form of regulation are often multimeric 
    and have allosteric binding sites for regulatory substances. 
    Their substrate/velocity plots are not hyperbolar, but sigmoidal (S-shaped).

    <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
    <h2>Irreversible inhibitors</h2>
        <p>Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, 
            and inhibition can therefore not be reversed. 
            Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional groups 
            such as nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, 
            Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. 
            These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to 
            form covalent adduct. The residues modified are those with side 
            chains containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; 
            these include the amino acids serine, cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.</p>
        <p>Irreversible inhibition is different from irreversible enzyme inactivation. 
            Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and 
            do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein 
            structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target. 
            For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of 
            all protein structure, but this is a non-specific effect. Similarly, 
            some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, 
            heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds 
            holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
    <h2>Uses of inhibitors</h2>
        <p>Since inhibitors modulate the function of enzymes they are often used as drugs. 
            A common example of an inhibitor that is used as a drug is aspirin, which 
            inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger 
            prostaglandin, thus suppressing pain and inflammation. However, other enzyme 
            inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible 
            enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site 
            of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini" data-collapsed="=false">
<h2>Enzyme Activator</h2>
    <p>Enzyme activators are molecules that bind to enzymes and increase their activity. 
        They are the opposite of enzyme inhibitors. These molecules are often involved 
        in the allosteric regulation of enzymes in the control of metabolism. 
        An example of an enzyme activator working in this way is fructose 
        2,6-bisphosphate, which activates phosphofructokinase 1 and increases 
        the rate of glycolysis in response to the hormone insulin.</p>

            <h2>Tempreture</h2>
                <img alt="tempreture" src="tempreture.png">
                <p>As the temperature rises, reacting molecules have more and more 
                    kinetic energy. This increases the chances of a successful collision 
                    and so the rate increases. There is a certain temperature at which an 
                    enzyme's catalytic activity is at its greatest (see graph). 
                    This optimal temperature is usually around human body temperature 
                    (37.5 oC) for the enzymes in human cells.</p>

<p>Above this temperature the enzyme structure begins to break down (denature) 
                    since at higher temperatures intra- and intermolecular bonds are 
                    broken as the enzyme molecules gain even more kinetic energy.</p>
            </div>
                <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
            <h2>pH</h2>
                <img alt="tempreture" src="ph.png">
                    <p>Each enzyme works within quite a small pH range. 
                        There is a pH at which its activity is greatest (the optimal pH). 
                        This is because changes in pH can make and break intra- and 
                        intermolecular bonds, changing the shape of the enzyme and, 
                        therefore, its effectiveness.</p>
                    </div>
                <div data-role="collapsible" class="ui-mini">
                <h2>Concentration of Enzyme and Substrate</h2>
                    <p>The rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction depends on the concentrations of enzyme and substrate. 
                        As the concentration of either is increased the rate of reaction 
                        increases.</p>
                    <p>For a given enzyme concentration, the rate of reaction increases with increasing substrate 
                        concentration up to a point, above which any further increase in 
                        substrate concentration produces no significant change in reaction 
                        rate. This is because the active sites of the enzyme molecules at 
                        any given moment are virtually saturated with substrate. 
                        The enzyme/substrate complex has to dissociate before the active 
                        sites are free to accommodate more substrate.</p>
                    <p>Provided that the substrate concentration is high and that temperature 
                        and pH are kept constant, the rate of reaction is proportional to 
                        the enzyme concentration.</p>

            <div data-role="main" class="ui-content">
            <p>Hormone is a class of signaling molecules 
                produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported 
                by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology 
                and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures that include 
                eicosanoids, steroids, amino acid derivatives, peptides, and proteins. 
                The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. 
                The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by 
                cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signaling) or 
                nearby cells (paracrine signaling).</p>
                <p>Hormones are used to communicate between organs and tissues to 
                    regulate physiological and behavioral activities, such as digestion, 
                    metabolism, respiration, tissue function, sensory perception, sleep, 
                    excretion, lactation, stress, growth and development, movement, 
                    reproduction, and mood. Hormones affect distant cells by binding to 
                    specific receptor proteins in the target cell resulting in a change 
                    in cell function. When a hormone binds to the receptor, it results 
                    in the activation of a signal transduction pathway. This may lead 
                    to cell type-specific responses that include rapid non-genomic 
                    effects or slower genomic responses where the hormones acting through 
                    their receptors activate gene transcription resulting in increased 
                    expression of target proteins.</p>
                <p>Hormone synthesis may occur in specific tissues of endocrine glands 
                    or in other specialized cells. Hormone synthesis occurs in response 
                    to specific biochemical signals induced by a wide range of regulatory 
                    systems. For instance, ionized calcium concentration affects PTH 
                    synthesis, whereas glucose concentration affects insulin synthesis. 
                    Regulation of hormone synthesis of gonadal, adrenal, and thyroid 
                    hormones is often dependent on complex sets of direct influence and 
                    feedback interactions involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
                    (HPA), -gonadal (HPG), and -thyroid (HPT) axes.</p>
                <p>Upon secretion, certain hormones, including protein hormones and 
                    catecholamines, are water soluble and are thus readily transported 
                    through the circulatory system. Other hormones, including steroid 
                    and thyroid hormones, are lipid soluble; to allow for their widespread 
                    distribution, these hormones must bond to carrier plasma glycoproteins 
                    (e.g., thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)) to form ligand-protein 
                    complexes. Some hormones are completely active when released into 
                    the bloodstream (as is the case for insulin and growth hormones), 
                    while others must be activated in specific cells through a series 
                    of activation steps that are commonly highly regulated. 
                    The endocrine system secretes hormones directly into the bloodstream 
                    typically into fenestrated capillaries, whereas the exocrine system 
                    secretes its hormones indirectly using ducts. Hormones with paracrine 
                    function diffuse through the interstitial spaces to nearby target 
                    tissue.</p>
