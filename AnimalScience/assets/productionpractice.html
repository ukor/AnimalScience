            <div data-role="main" class="ui-content">
       
                <p>There are three primary farming enterprises. These are </p>
        <ul>
        <li>breeding and hatchery operations</li>
            <li>commercial egg production, and</li>
            <li>broiler production</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other enterprises that provide supportive services are specialized breeding farms for production of pure lines, grandparent and parent stock, feed milling and processing and marketing of poultry products. In addition products and services are also closely associated with the primary enterprises.</p>
        <dl>
        <dt>Breeding and Hatching of Commercial Day Old Chicks</dt>
        <dd>This enterprise involves the rearing of parent stock hens and cocks in the correct ratio to produce fertile eggs, which are then hatched with the use of incubators and hatchers. The chicks so hatched are then sold out to poultry producers who are engaged in the production of table eggs or commercial broilers. The primary products of this enterprise are day-old chicks. Eggs that are not good for hatching and the old hens and cocks are secondary products. Breeder’s flocks may be egg types or broilers.</dd>
            <dt>Table egg production</dt>
        <dd>: For table egg product, pullets are purchased from a hatchery and these are then brooded and reared to the age of about five months before they begin laying eggs. The chicks purchased must have been separated (sexed) into male and females prior to sale. The primary products of this enterprise are eggs, which are sold for consumption. The hens are sold out as spent hens at the end of their laying cycle, which is usually about one year.</dd>
            <dt>Broiler Production</dt>
        <dd>: broiler production has the fastest rate of return of all the poultry enterprises. Commercial day old broiler chicks are purchased from the hatchery and reared to market between seven to ten weeks old, when they should be ready for market between 1. 6 – 2. Kg each. The broilers may be sold live or processed (fresh or frozen).</dd>
        <dt>Integration Projects</dt>
        <dd>The three primary enterprises are often integrated on large-scale farms. Integration often includes feed milling and product processing as well as other ancillary enterprises. The major advantage of such integrated projects is the reliability of sources and supply of primary inputs. It also promotes the enforcement of quality control measures in the production of feed and poultry products.</dd>
        <dt>Feed Milling</dt>
            <dd>Because feed accounted for between 60 – 80% of the cost of producing meat and eggs and the crucial need for quality controls, most large-scale poultry producers often make their own feed. Feed milling involves the procurement of ingredients needed to produce feed, grinding, mixing and enclosing in bags.</dd>
            <dt>Line Breeding and Grandparent Stock Production</dt>
        <dd>The production of pure lines and the different types of parent stocks are highly specialized fields of poultry production that rely on the expertise of well trained and tested poultry breeders. It is extremely critical since in the long run commercial egg and broiler production would phase out if such breeding work is not maintained. Furthermore, it is at that level that the initial selection and breeding for desirable economic traits occurs.</dd>
