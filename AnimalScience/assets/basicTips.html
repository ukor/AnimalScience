                <h3>General Mangement Considerations</h3>
                <p>It is important to note that the more time manager can personally devote to the maintenance of the herd the better the chances of success. It is also crucial for the producer to have sound knowledge about animal management because ignorance of certain basic facts or principles can result in great loss of stock or income. Experience in most instances guarantees confidence to succeed. Suggested practical steps or tips are meant to inspire confidence in farm animal production.</p>
            <dl>
            <dt>Stockmanship</dt>
                <dd>This concerns relationship and rapport between a husbandman and his stock. A good stockman is firm and irregularities pays attention to the needs of his stock. He is highly sensitive to and watches for in the behaviour or condition of individual animal. He also anticipates problems ahead of action or inaction. He carries out his routine activities with calmness and diligence, and minimises upsetting or scaring the herd or flock of stock. Even in an attempt to restrain or attend to a member of the herd, calmness of the herd is minimally disrupted through the use of retraining materials or facilities that guarantee peace.</dd>
                <dt>Cleanliness and Hygiene</dt>
                <dd>Maintenance of good hygiene in the livestock farm environment does not only reduce incidence of diseases and parasites in farm animals but it also has a beneficial effect on staff morale to work in clean environment. Routine farm operations should allow for periodic cleaning, emptying and resting of pens for sufficient time before stocking. Cleaning of a used pen must be immediate involving scrubbing, washing and disinfecting and left dry to break lifecycle of parasites and recurrence of diseases.</dd>
                <dt>Evalation and Selection for Replacement</dt>
                <dd>The stock population of a farm is dynamic. New purchases and selection from the existing herd is being consistently undertaken for replacement. Evaluation and selection of desirable animal is the first test for considering eligibility for the replacement of old, non-performing or disposed animal. New purchases from open market scarcely have records to use as basis for evaluation. The stockman in such circumstance is left with option of visual evaluation or the physical appraisal/scoring technique. Traditionally this involves observation of physical appearance relating to its health, alertness, agility and absence of other defects. The relative meatiness or physical body condition may be determined on the basis of a combination of physical feel at arious points such as the pin bones, tail setting, loin area, backbone or ribs. Besides its traditional use in identifying, selecting and purchasing stock, physical appraisal is quite useful as a guide for management and feed requirement. For example in beef production enterprise, animals identified to have finished in terms of the required conformation and deposition of fat may be culled for slaughter or market while those that are yet to meet the target are offered high level diet to finish early. In few instances feed quality is reduced to lower the rate of fat deposition.</dd>
                <dt>Record Keeping</dt>
                <dd>In order to measure both the technical andeconomic efficiency of a livestock enterprise, it is essential to keep some basic records. These should cover all aspects of the enterprise especially those concerned with the evaluation of the efficiency of the enterprise. For example, sire or dam productivity, lactation or growth performance of individual animal may be measured. The type and detail of a record depends on the information it is intended to provide and the accuracy of the recorder. The record sheet need not be over ambitious in showing too many details that lead to ambiguity. Record must be clear, dated and should indicate the period covered by information e.g. monthly and six monthly basis. A comparison of individual farm records with other farms or regional averages enables farms to assess their performance or efficiency as well as competition. One other important use of record keeping is to maintain overall productivity in the herd by having a culling policy, so that animals are moved as soon as performance falls below predetermined due to age, injury, lameness, poor litter size, poor mothering ability, low fertility are rationales for culling. Note that lifetime performance of a stock will be necessary for the selection of its offspring or progeny for replacement.</dd>
                <dt>Water and Feed Consumption</dt>
                <dd>The importance of water for consumption, cleaning and ambient temperature control in the tropical herd cannot be ignored in the productivity of stock. The absence of regular supply of clean, fresh water is often the first factor that limits feed intake. While specific objectives of the enterprise and the management system adopted dictate the sophistication of the feeding method. Feeding and management must be geared to optimize performance. The small-scale rural producer, for example, will attempt to maximize the use of cheaper, lower quality feedstuff. It is expected that stock produced under such feeding condition will experience slower growth rate as a consequence of limitation of farm animal to utilise bulky fibrous and low quality feedstuff. Under commercial conditions different priorities may give feed utilisation efficiency and cost, growth rate, carcass leanness and grading according to the relative economic advantages they provide. Other major decisions relating to feed system to be adopted may include:</dd>

            </dl>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Restricted or ad lib feeding:</strong>  Restricted feeding is known for its firm control on feed wastage and feed cost, excess fattiness in carcasses. Ad lib feeding saves labour gives faster growth rate and larger carcass weight, as well as removes competition at the feed trough which must be designed to operate efficiently to minimize waste. Both restricted and ad lib feeding methods should be combined to yield the most desirable result.</li>
                <li><strong>Meal or Pillet: </strong>Pelleted feeds have consistently shown to be superior to meal by as much as about 5% in promoting live weight gain and food conversion efficiency. The marginal gains must be compared with extra cost of pellets above the cost of meal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seprate Feeding System: </strong> Handling of bulky feed separately from protein concentrate has proven to optimize economic efficiency of production. In such system for example bulky feed such as fresh cassava roots are dry and fed directly to pigs to appetite twice weekly. Protein concentrate is then fed daily according to a fixed rate (500g for weaners up to 50kg live weight, 75g for finishers above 50kg). The system maximize added value from farm production. Nutrient balance may be suboptimal but it is highly efficient in term of economic of production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Special Feeding or Life cycle Feeding: </strong>Techniques are widely gaining importance due to their timely effectiveness. Examples of such techniques are:</li>
                </ul>
                <dl>
                <dt>Creep feeding</dt>
                    <dd>As the name implies feeding young animals especially piglets in nest or creep where the dams have no access to consume the feed. Weaning feed for young animal can be easily consumed by adults if enough protection is not provided to deter the adult pen mates. Creep feeding enhances growth of the piglets, helps the digestive system to adjust to change from milk to solid diet prior to weaning and prevents nutritional stress associated with ‘suckling pressure’ of the dam.</dd>
                    <dt>Topping</dt>
                    <dd>This is another form of feeding specially applied to dry animals in preparation for breeding. It is offered three-four weeks prior to breeding. The feed is required to be of relatively high quality in terms of energy, protein and mineral-vitamins to enable growth and development of body tissues needed for efficient reproduction. Both breeding male and female may benefit from topping at the beginning of breeding season. It may also be extended to pregnant female during foetus growth.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h3>Economic Consideration</h3>
                <p>The potential profitability of a livestock enterprise varies considerably from country to country and between regions within a country. In either large or small scale production, prospective livestock producers need to consider some economic points or questions before undertaking an enterprise particularly involving live animals or animal products to avoid disillusionment and loss of money.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Is there an assured market for the stock or animal product intended to be produced. Closely related to this is how to sell the products without incurring too high cost? Is the price on offer adequate for products adequate to justify cost and profitability? Will it be necessary to site the farm closer to the market and what is the possibility to expand the market or production in future for increased income?</li>
                    <li>Do I have sufficient funds to get started? Money is needed for fixed capital costs i.e. buildings and equipment and working capital to pay for stock, feed and labour for the first year of operation. Note that cash expense tends to increase in the first year and cash receipt takes similar duration to begin to come after the take-off of the enterprise.</li>
                    <li>What are the possible directions for expansion or integration to enable the enterprise take advantage of various opportunities production or marketing available. Is there more suitable stock or breeds available for the type of system or operations in managing the enterprise?</li>
                    <li>Do I have unhindered access to input supplies at suitable costs especially for feed resources, water, drugs, power as well as infrastructures such as access road and construction materials?</li>
                    <li>Do I have the requisite managerial competent to engage in the enterprise or employ competent experts and labour force to undertake production at desirable level.</li>
                    <li>Specifically important to these considerations is the overall security of the farm against corrupt tendencies of the employees, over invoicing of purchases by contracting agent, pilfering or organised act of robbery at every unit of the enterprise.</li>
                   
                </ol>
                <p>It is also important to bear in mind a few concepts of financial and economic analyses to enable quick determination of profitability. Financial analysis has to do with returns to the farmer or operator of enterprise. It gives an indication of the profitability level of the enterprise when both costs of production and the returns are considered.</p>
                <p>The cost of production consist of variable and fixed costs while gross return or gross revenues concerns the total value of production. The profit is the difference between gross return and total cost of production. Fixed cost is derived from expenses incurred in acquiring the breeding/replacement stock, housing, waterers, feeders’ crates, measuring scale, farm land, equipment and infrastructures. Variable costs arise from expenditures pertaining to concentrate feed, hay, labour, drugs, transportation, marketing and miscellaneous expenses. Net returns or profit is derived from the gross profit after deduction of marketing, administrative costs and taxes have been made. It is advisable for beginner to raise his own stock and initiate his own project within his own resources without any external source of funds.</p>
                <p>Economic analysis covers profitability of the entire farm enterprise. It discusses pay-back period, break-even analysis, benefit-cost ratio, internal rate of return and net present worth which are indicators of profitability and sustainability of enterprise.
