            <p>Ruminant Animals are animals with a complex stomach unlike the non-ruminants that 
                have simple stomach. They are animals having four compartment stomach namely: 
                rumen, reticulum and abomasums. They eat and digest forages or plant based feed 
                by swallowing it first and allowing it to get moistened in the rumem which 
                is the first compartment of  the complex stomach. The swallowed food is 
                later regurgitated by the animal and re-chewed to break down the plant 
                materials for digestion. This process is called rumination or chewing the cud. 
                Examples of ruminant  animals are cattle. Sheep, goats, camel, water buffalo, 
                giraffes, antelopes to mention but a few. However we shall limit our 
                discussion in this study to cattle sheep and goats that are commonly 
                found in our environment.</p>
                <p>Ruminant animals are categorized into two main 
                    classes based on their body size namely. <i>The large ruminant animals</i> and 
                    small ruminant animals. Examples of large ruminants are cattle, water 
                    buffalo, giraffe, camel etc while <i>small ruminants</i> are sheep, goat, antelope etc. 
                    ruminants have an advantage of the ability  to eat and utilize law 
                    quality fibrous food that cannot be eaten by human and non-ruminants.</p>

            <p>Sheep was first domesticated in the new stone age. 
                Evidence for the domestication of sheep dates to 9000 BC in lraq. 
                DNA analysis has shown that domestic sheep are descended from two 
                ancestor species one of which is the <b><i>moufflon.</i></b> The moufflons comprise 
                ovis musion and Ovis orientalis. Although the second ancestor has not 
                been identified both the urial and argali have been ruled out. 
                The urial (O. vignei) is found from northeastern run to northwestern india. 
                It has  ahigher number of chromosomes (58) than domestic sheep (54) which 
                makes it an unlikely ancestor of the latter but it interbreeds with the 
                moufflon. The arguli sheep (O. ammon)  of inner Asia (Tibet, Himalayas. 
                Itay mountains tien-sha and pamir) has 56 chromosomes and the Siberian 
                snow sheep (Ovis nivcold)  has 52 chromosomes. This soay ram demonstrates 
                the wide variance in sheep traits  that belts the prototypical appearance 
                of te animal. Historical records show that sheep provided primitive 
                pastoral people with meat wool tallow skin and milk.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of Sheep Production</h2>
                <p>As compared to other classes of livestock. 
                    Sheep possesses the following natural advantages.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Sheep help control weeds.</li>
                    <li>Sheep production does 
                        not require elaborate facilities and equipment.</li>
                    <li>They are particularly good
                         in the utilization of more arid type of grazing </li>
                    <li>They are good at
                         utilizing wasteland and are also excellent scavengers.</li>
                    <li>Sheep consume roughage as their primary feed.</li>
                    <li>Compared to cattle, they produce more 
                        liberally in proportion to what consume </li>
                    <li>Some breeds, e.g. the wool type produce two products-wool 
                        and lamb available for market at two different periods of 
                        the year.</li>
                    <li>Their returns come quickly; 
                        lambs may be marketed 8 months after the ewes are bred.</li>
                    <li>Sheep droppings are particularly less subjected to wastes 
                        because of the way they are dropped and tramped into the soil.</li>
                    <li>Their young ones, if properly fed, 
                        may be marketed when about a year old.</li>
                    <li>Their energy requirements are lower than those for other livestock enterprises.<br> 
                        Also the energy requirements for fibre 
                        production by sheep are lower than those for synthetic fibres.</li>
                    <li>Sheep are highly adaptable an non competitive with humans for feed.</li>
                    <li>Sheep are easy to handle and generally require little input.</li>
                    <li>They reduce risks of losses to owners by being cheaper to replace.</li>
                    <li>Subsistence farmers keeping sheep need very small amounts of <br>
                        purchased animal feed because 
                        their stock can manage on very poor quality
                         roughage if required.</li>
                    <li>With a 20% death rate a farmer with five sheep or goats 
                        will still have four animals.<br>
                         Whereas a farmer with one buffalo or cow is likely to be left with
                         nothing </li>
                    <li>Sheep milk is the most nutritious milk on sale in the world 
                        today.<br> Because of its high calcium content, sheep milk is also<br> 
                        very good for the prevention 
                        of osteoporosis and for those people already suffering from it.</li>
                    <li>Sheep milk is an excellent raw material for the milk<br>
                         processing industry especially in cheese production.</li>
                    <li>Sheep with their small body size high productive capacity 
                        and rapid growth rates<br>
                         are ideally suited to production by resource-poor stallholders.</li>

           <p>In starting any livestock enterprise. Certain factors such as land, 
               breed of stock and infra-structural 
               facilities and their cost need be adequately considered.</p>
                <h3>Land</h3>
                <p>Under extensive grazing conditions, land requirement is 1.6-4.0ha 
                    per 100 sheep. However under intensive management 
                    a well established pasture of 1 ha would support 26-40 sheep.</p>
                <h3>Breed</h3>
                <p>It is advisable to use breeds adaptable to the ecological zones 
                    where the enterprise is to be set 
                    e.g for this zone use the west African dward or the yankasa.</p>
                <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>An office accommodation for a large enterprise adequate fencing 
                    because of their size require chain link fencing or close fencing. 
                    Chain links are at present very costly, 
                    so wood posts plus wire but designed to be close will be adequate.</p>
                <h3>Foundation Stock</h3>
                <p>foundation stock for starting sheep rearing enterprise should be 
                    purchased from reputable sheep breeding farms or government farms. 
                    This would ensure purity high genetic
                quality and freedom from disease. Unfortunately however, 
                    the numbers of available breeding farms are limited. </p>
                    <p>The open market therefore becomes the place of choice for 
                        the purchase of breeding stock. In purchasing animals from 
                        the open market attention must 
                    be given to the animals health age and physical appearance. </p>
                <h3>Health</h3>
                <p>All ewes selected must be in a thrifty vigorous condition. They 
                    should have every appearance of a life of usefulness ahead of them
                     and give every evidence of raising strong healthy lambs. 
                    Such animals should be free of catarrh diarrhea and  skin diseases.
                     Also ensure that animals are free ectoparasites such as ticks and 
                    fleas. </p>
                <h3>Age</h3>
                <p>It is advisable to buy sheep 11/2-3 years old. The age of sheep could 
                    be determined using their teeth. The lamb has narrow teeth known 
                    as milk teeth. At 12-14 months the 2 center incisors are replaced 
                    by two large broad permanent teeth while those 3 years have permanent 
                    teeth. At 2-21/2 years they have 4 permanent teeth while those 3 years 
                    have a permanent teeth and at above 4 years, they have 8 permanent teeth.</p>
                <h3>Physical Apperance</h3>
                <p>Animal with physical defects such as lameness. 
                    Blindness and  malformed toes should be avoided lean and 
                    stunted animals should be avoided. Purchased animals should 
                    be fine looking active have bright eyes ad fine (rather than seruffy 
                    and rough) coats. It is advisable to buy in small batches from as 
                    many gentic variability as possible. Initial health precaution: 
                    it is good husbandry practice to quarantine newly purchased animals 
                    for I month before introduction to the herd.</p>

                humidity all of which indirectly affect performance farers are 
                advised to raise those breeds that predominate in their ecological zones. 
                Thus while the Yankasa and Uda are suitable for the Guinea and Sudan zone. 
                The west African Dwarf and Yankasa breeds should be raised in the humid

            <div data-role="main" class="ui-content">
            <p>Ideally foundation breeding stock should be purchased from reputable 
                sheep breeding farms or government livestock investigation and 
                Breeding Centres LIBC so as to be certain of their purity high 
                genetic quality and freedom from diseases. Unfortunately such 
                sources are too few at present and where they exist, the number 
                of breeding animal available for sale is limited. This leaves the 
                open market as the main sources of breeder stock for farmers.</p>
                <p>In purchasing animals from the market major consideration 
                    must be given to the animals health age and physical appearance. 
                    The behavior and posture of an animal are reflections of its 
                    health status. Age can be determined from 
                    the number and size of teeth. 
                    Therefore the farmer is advised to:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Buy animals that are from obvious diseases such catarrh. 
                    Diarrhea and skin diseases. Also ensure that animals <br>
                    are free of ectoparasites such as fleas and ticks on their 
                    bodies.</li>
                    <li>Avoid animals with physical defects such as lameness. 
                        Walk the animal around to find out blindness 
                        and malformations.</li>
                    <li>A lean or stunted animal should be avoided. 
                        Buy only alert, fine 
                        looking and active animals with bright eyes and fine coat.</li>
                    <li>Ewes (female sheep) should be between 1.5 and 3 years of age.</li>
                    <li>A -1.5 to 2 year-old sheep has two broad (big) central teeth, a-2 to<br>
                         2.5 year-old has 4. While those aged about 3 years have 6
                         big teeth</li>
                    <li>Buy in small batches from many markets in different localities 
                        so as to have animals that are as unrelated 
                        as possible and to have genetic variety in your foundation stock.</li>

            <div data-role="main" class="ui-content">
            <p>A number of sheep management systems have been described in Nigeria. 
                These management systems range from free range to tethering in 
                subsistence production to confinement in semi-intensive and 
                intensive systems.</p>
            <div data-role="collapsible-set">
            <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
            <h2>Extensive or Traditional System </h2>
                <p>In Nigeria the system of husbandry is mainly traditional with individuals 
                    keeping 2 to 4 animals on which investment is minimal but potential 
                    returns are still high. These systems of husbandry are characterized 
                    by trekking and exposure to high ambient temperatures. 
                    Animals lose body weight while moving. The traditional system of 
                    management is characterized by high incidence of diseases and 
                    parasitism, together with the adverse effects of tropical climate. 
                    Other characteristics include losses to stealing motor accidents 
                    poisoning by crop farmers and conflicts between livestock owners 
                    and crop farmers losses to predators and indiscriminate mating.</p>
            </div>
                <div data-role="collapsible">
                <h2>Semi-Intensive System</h2>
                    <p>The semi-intensive management system 
                        is intermediate between the intensive 
                        and the traditional management system. 
                        The system involves grazing of the animals 
                        on any available herbage during the day and housing them 
                        during the night. On the other hand the sheep is still fed in 
                        the morning and in the evening. Animals were observed for disease 
                        problem and veterinary care was provided.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-role="collapsible">
                <h2>Intensive System</h2>
                    <p>The intensive system would involve complete confinement of the animals 
                        either in pastures or in pens where feed and water are provided. 
                        Here crop residues such as rice straw and bran cassava peels brewers 
                        dry grain are provided. Improved nutrition could be achieved through the 
                        use of cut and carry grasses legumes or browse supplemented with salt slicks. 
                        Under this situation adequate nutrition is ensured and the welfare of the 
                        animals is constantly monitored with full veterinary care being provided. 
                        The greatest advantages of this system are effective conversion of crop 
                        residues or supplement to products of high biological value such as milk and meat. 
                        There is control of reproduction improved performance and hygienic conditions 
                        collection and use of faecal materials as farm yard manures reduction in cases 
                        of parasitic diseases control of sheep against auto-knock downs and little or 
                        no damage to the environment.</p>

            <p>Sheep must be adequately fed for optimum performance poor 
                nutrition is one of the major factors limiting the productivity of indigenous 
                ruminants in Nigeria. In order to develop a viable ruminants industry animals 
                should be fed properly. Though sheep feed mainly on roughage (grasses legumes brose etc). 
                It is necessary to give them supplements in order to improve their production. 
                Proper management of the breeding flock improves productivity and reduces lamb mortality. 
                Essentially feeds contain energy protein fibre minerals vitamins and water feeding of sheep 
                depends the age of the animal physiological state of the animal (lactation pregnancy) 
                and the quantity of the roughage being fed.</p>
                <h3>Feeding of Adult Animals</h3>
                <p>Hay or crop residue should be provided always in addition 1-2kg. animal/day 
                    of legume hay e.g. groundnut haulms beans pod cowpea residue. 
                    Animals at this stage need feed for maintenance. 
                    It is therefore not necessary to over feed them.</p>
            <h3>Feeding of Pregnant Sheep</h3>
                <p>In addition to supply of hay a farmer should feed good quality legume hay at the rate of 1.5-2.5kg/ Animal/day or 
                    concentrate can be fed at a daily rate of 200 -300kg/ animal/day. 
                    But higher levels of feeding can be 
                    maintained especially during the last month of pregnancy when the foctus grows 
                    very rapidly and causes an increased demand on the mother’s food 
                    supply Good feeding results in the following.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Provides nourishment for the developing foctus and usually 
                    results in a strong kid lamb at birth.</li>
                    <li>Good feeding enhances the development of the 
                        udder and  ensure adequate milk production </li>
                    <li>It builds up body reserves of flesh on ewe.</li>
                    <li>It prepares the dam for the difficult task of parturition</li>

                </ol>
                <p>This practices of enhanced feeding just before parturition is referred to a steaming up.</p>
                <h3>Feeding of Nursing or Lactating Females.</h3>
                <p>This group of animals can be fed like pregnant females but the level of feeding should be slightly increased. 
                    This is to ensure that the dam produces enough milk for feeding the offspring. 
                    In addition hay and concentrate supplement should be provided at the rate of 300-500gm/Animals/day.</p>
                <p>Adequate feeding of lactating ewes increases the survival rate of the lambs 
                    increases the resistance of diseases of the 
                    young-ones and ensure a fast growth rate.</p>
                <h3>feeding of Growers</h3>
                <p>A supplement of 0.5-1kg legume hay/Animal/day 
                    in addition to free choice feeding of roughage is sufficient 
                    for this class of animals.</p>
                <h3>Feeding of Breeding Males</h3>
                <p>When males are not in service they should be maintained on good grazing or crop residue ad lib plus 1-2kg legume 
                    hay/animal/day. About a month to being used for service they should be place on good grazing or crop residue plus 
                    300gm of concentrate mixture. 
                    This practice of enhanced feeding prior to breeding is referred to as <b><i>flushing.</i></b></p>
               
                <ol>
                Flushing has the following advantages:
                    <li>In males it increases the quantity and quality of semen produced.</li>
                    <li>In females it increases the number of ova shade.</li>
                    <li>Ensures a greater chance of turning/triplets in the dam.</li>
                    <li>Increases the conception rate.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <hr class="break">
                <br>
                <p>Care should be taken to prevent the overfeeding of the male as this will lead fattening which is 
                    not desired in breeding males.</p>

                Housing is essential for overnight shelter and provides security against predators for the sheep. 
                Also it provides protection against rain and cold. </p>
                <h3>Importance of Housing</h3>

                <h2>Protection from Adverse Weather Condition</h2>
                    <p>The major function of a sheep house is to protect the animal from adverse 
                        climatic condition such as sunshine rain wind or cold. 
                        For the most part adult sheep are equipped to withstand cold due to 
                        heat produce during the fermentation process but young lambs have not yet 
                        develop this mechanism and should therefore be protected sheep do not like 
                        being drench be heavy rain nor excessive such particularly when the sun is at its height. 
                        These can clearly be seen by the attempts the animals 
                        make to seek shelter from excessive sun or rain.</p>
                </div>
                    <div data-role="collapsible">
                    <h2>Better Surveillance </h2>
                        <p>When sheep are kept together in a house the owner can better observe them. 
                            He is therefore in a better position to notice sick animals and treat 
                            appropriately before the disease is spread.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div data-role="collapsible">
                    <h2>Protection from Predactors</h2>
                        <p>By the provision of a house sheep are protected from 
                            predators such as dogs snakes thieves accidents and 
                            other harmful vices.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div data-role="collapsible">
                    <h2>Easy Handling</h2>
                        <p>Handling is easier animals can be caught and flock management is 
                            improved because it allows for certain management practices such as isolation of 
                            rams outside breeding season and weaning to be carried out. 
                            Other management practices such as identification docking 
                            and castration can be done easily.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div data-role="collapsible">
                    <h2>Feeding of Supplements is Easier </h2>
                        <p>This is because animal of the same age physiological state such as yearlings 
                            gestation fattening weaning can be kept in the same group. 
                            This improves performance since each animal receives supplement 
                            meant to meet its particular production requirement.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            <p>Provision of housing leads to overall improvement in the performance of the animals. 
                Sheep housing can vary from a low mud-wall building with thatched roof to a prick or 
                concrete wall with corrugated iron sheets roofing. Also corruaged iron walled building could be used. 
                Such housing should be located on a well-drained soil. 
                It should be well ventilated to avoid dampness.
                 The floor can be of cement or rammed earth it should 
                be easy to clean and should be covered with good 
                bedding material such as straw or wood shavings 
                which can be changed from time to time.</p>
                <p>The building may be divided into pens. Floor space requirements for lambs 
                    and adult sheep are about 0.4 and 1.7m2 respectively in addition floor space 
                    should be provided for  feed and water troughs. 
                    There should be more pens per building or more than one building 
                    with separate for males females and weaner.</p>
                <p>A store and a hay could form part of the building. 
                    Alternatively the hay barn could be a separate structure. 
                    A run (enclosure) made of chain link wire waist-high may be construed in front of the pens. 
                    Divided into at least two sections for males and females if housed in different pens in a single building. 
                    Water supply can be from a well tap and bore hole or river. 
                    It should be clean and in sufficient quantity.</p>
                <p>Feed and water troughs should be provided in every pen, 
                    either built-in or moveable type. A rectangular feed trough measuring 4 x 0.3 x 0.15m is 
                    adequate for 10 adult sheep. Simple feed troughs could be made by cutting a drum lengthwise 
                    into two halves. If cut drums used the edges should be 
                    made blunt to avoid injuries to the animals. 
                    Large plastic basins are better as water troughs a 
                    age unlike metal drums they do not corrode.</p>
                <p>A foot-bath is required for the prevention and treatment of foot-rot, 
                    a very common problem with sheep on wet grounds. The most common types 
                    is the walk-through type which is a shallow long receptacle. 
                    Where a small number of sheep is involved a bucket of basin may be used.</p>
                <p>A dip is an essential structure in a sheep farm. 
                    The walk-in short-swim type is the most common. 
                    In this type the animal enters the vats are best made with concrete.</p>
                <p>A vat measuring 6 x 1.2 x 0.75m has a capacity of about 2000 litres. 
                    It is necessary to put a roof over the vat to prevent rain from diluting the chemical. 
                    In small-sized flocks a 200-liter drum opened at one end can be used. 
                    The animals are immersed, one at a time in the dipping 
                    solution contained in the drum for about 30 seconds. 
                    A knapsack sprayer can also used.</p>

            <p>Handling in sheep management could simply be defined as a way in which 
                the husbandman drag, push or carry the animal to where they will be fed, 
                administered drug for research purpose for observation and study of their behavior. 
                Good handling of small ruminant will prevent the animal from being injured and  
                guarantee the safety of the handler. If sheep are to be caught and handled for 
                any reason they should be confined to a small corral or shed appropriate way 
                to handle sheep are:</p>
            <ul data-role="listview">
            <li>Husbandman or attend and must know how to relate with the animals<br>
                 since animal communicate in one way or the other<br>
                 e.g. if a ram use its leg to scratch the ground<br>
                 continuously it simply means it is ready to attack anybody.</li>
                <li>Sheep may best be caught around the neck by the hind<br>
                     leg or by the rear flank. They  should be carried by<br>
                     allowing the hind leg to fold towards the front while<br>
                     using the other hand to hold the remaining leg.<br>
                     Never should they be caught by the wool.</li>
                <li>The young animal should  be carried close to the<br>

                <p>Generally what matter most is the good relationship with

        </div>
            <div data-role="main" class="ui-content">
             <p>The reproductive activity of sheep is stimulated by  variations in the length. 
                    In northern hemisphere where day length varies with the season of the year 
                    oestrus takes place mostly from July  to October as opposed to the tropics 
                    where there is only little variation in the length of day and the oestrus 
                    cycle resources  through the yea. Ewes come on  hest (oestrus) at regular 
                    intervals of about 18-21 days if not bred (Oestrus cycle). 
                    The oestrus period (the only period the female can accept the male) 
                    last for about 3 days or 72 hours.</p>
            <h3>Age at Puberty</h3>
                <p>Sheep attain puberty at 5-6 months sexual organ of rams already functional at  
                    this time. However rams should not be used before age 11/2 years while ewe lamb
                     could be bred at 9-12 months. It is good practice to replace breeding rams with
                     newly selected ones after each breeding season. A minimum of 6 rams should be in
                     a flock of 100 ewes feeding of breeding rams
                     should be improved 6 weeks before the breeding season</p>
                <h3>Estrous cycle</h3>
                <p>The estrous cycle in the ewe is 16-17 days with estrous duration being 20-42 hours i.e.
                     approximate 1-2 days average being 30 hours. Ovulation occurs in the ewe from about 
                    24-30 hours after the onest of estrous after 16-17 days. There are no visible signs
                     of heat in the sheep except the acceptance of the ram or teaser with an apron. 
                    This is the only external detection of heat in ewes. In flock mating, rams should
                     be left in flock for 6-8 weeks to ensure (3 estrous cycles) that all ewes are bred. 
                    After that they are withdrawn. Rams should be joined with ewes 2 weeks after lambing. 
                    The ewes will still be nursing their lambs at this stage but this does not prevent 
                    them from getting pregnant. Batch lambing could be ensured by synchronization using
                     progrestogne virginal sponges. Ewes lambing within 2-3 weeks interval would be synchronized.
                     This consists of inserting the progrestogen in-plants into their vaginal for 12 days. 
                    Introduction of rams to  treated 
                    flock 2 days before sponge removal would enhance ovulation. 
                    Mating does not begin until sponge removal.</p>
                <p>Estrous normally spread over 4 days following sponge removal.
                     Non-pregnant ewes would return to estrous 16-21 days following sponge removal. 
                    Gestation period in ewes   would return to estrous 16-21 days following sponge removal.
                     Gestation period in ewes is about 5 months i.e. 152 days. 
                    Repeat breeder ewes those weaning poor weight lambs 
                    and old ewes above 7 years should be culled.</p>

                <h3>Mating methods</h3>
                <p>There are two main mating methods in sheep: </p>
                <dl>
                <dt>Natural service</dt>
                    <dd>This involves the natural copulation of the ram to ewe. 
                        In Nigeria where most females and males are kept together there is no 
                        restriction to mating, where females are kept separately from males careful observation 
                        particularly in the early morning should be carried out
                         to notice females on heat so as to breed them.</dd>
                    <dt>Artificial Insemination </dt>
                    <dd>This has recently been given more attention but<br> is rarely practiced in Nigeria because;
                    
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <ol data-role="listview">

            <h2>Management of Lambs</h2>
                <p>The dam should be allowed to suckle lamb immediately after birth. 
                    This is because at this time dam’s milk contains colostrums. 
                    Colostrums contains antibodies which help to confer initial 
                    immunity to the lamb it also stimulates the  alimentary system. 
                    Colostrums production ceases around the third or fourth day after parturition. 
                    It is important to check the teat of the female to ensure that milk is available for the lamb. 
                    
                    
                    Weaning nibble at solid food such as leaves. Grasses at 2-3 weeks of age. 
                    Where a dam dies immediately after parturition artificial  colostrums should be provided. </p>

                <h2>Management of Ram</h2>
                    <p>Management of ram is very crucial to breeding and indeed the entire production of a sheep farm. 
                        If poorly cared for ram attain puberty at a prolonged age. Normally a well managed ram in terms 
                        of adequate feeding watering and health care attain puberty at about 6 months of age  if under 
                        intensive management system. The ram could be older if under the extensive system. 
                        Rams must be fed good nixture of grasses and legumes in addition to which concentrates 
                        may be given at about 300 to 500gm per head per day. The hooves must be adequately trimmed 
                        to prevent overgrowth and foot rot. They must be regularly disinfected (every quarter) to 
                        prevent external parasites. Ram for  breeding is kept in a  separate pen or paddock usually 
                        very close to the ewe to stimulate sexual desire. At  puberty sperm production of the ram is 
                        usually of low quality hence more mature and older rams must be used for mating. 
                        There is the tendency to over-use the ram in an extensive system of production. However, 
                        the acceptable  mating ratio of ram to ewe is between 1:20 and 1:3. 
                        Excess rams on the farm not  required for mating are often castrated. <b><i>Castrated rams are called weather.</i></b></p>

                <h2>Management of Bucks</h2>
                    <p>The buck is the male goat. 
                        It must attain the age of about 12 to 18 months of age  before it is used for mating. 
                        Even though it reaches puberty earlier than 12 months it is not advisable to use for mating. 
                        Buck should be penned separately to prevent indiscriminate mating. It must be fed good quality 
                        grass and legumes and given concentrate at about 300 to 50gm of concentrate on daily basis. A good 
                        buck can be used breeding for a period of  4 to 6 years effectively. The mating ratio is similar to what  
                        obtains in sheep. Bucks that are not being used for mating are usually castrated. <b><i>Castrated bucks are 
                        called bullocks and fattened for meat.</i></b></p>

                <h2>Management of Ewes</h2>
                    <p>A female sheep is called “ewe” it comes to puberty at about the age of 6 to 12 
                        months depending on adequate feeding and healthcare. When nutrition is poor sheep 
                        comes to puberty as late as about 20 months. Attainment of puberty has been shown to be 
                        related to the body weight of the animal and breed. Large breeds have been shown to reach 
                        puberty much later than small breeds. The moment a ewe is selected for breeding it 
                        must be separated and not allowed to run with rams to avoid indiscriminate 
                        mating. Apart from nutrition the reproductive life of sheep is also 
                        influenced by photoperiod or day-length or season particularly 
                        in the temperate region. In the tropics and where there is 
                        adequate feeding this effect do not show as there exist 
                        little variation in day length period throughout 
                        the year. Conception rate in ewe can be 
                        increased by improving the quality 
                        of feed given to the animal 
                        which subsequently 
                        encourages 
                        ovulation. 
                        <i>This process is called flushing.</i> 
                        It may require putting the female animal on a green pasture 
                        with quality concentrate a month beore mating. A female sheep comes 
                        to oestrus or heat from 6 months of age and thereafter heat re-occurs at 
                        every 15 to 17 days. Ewe must not be allowed for mating at the first oestrus. 
                        Oestrus lasts 20 to 42 hours in sheep. The heat signs are similar to what you have 
                        learnt for cattle.</p>

                <h2>Management of Pregnant Ewes</h2>
                    <p>After mating, the ewe must be separated from the flock and kept in individual pen 
                        or monitored to ensure safety to prevent abortion. The ram must not be allowed to
                         run with the females again if on pasture. They must be grazed on separate paddock or
                         the  prepuce of the  penis tied to the scrotum to prevent aggressive mating from the males.
                         Ewes must be well  fed with 
                        good grass-legume mixtures with minerals as supplements in form of block multinutrients if available.</p>
                    <p>Concentrates at about 200 to 600g per day may be given toward 
                        the latter part of pregnancy (6 to 8 weeks) to provide extra nutrients for the developing foetus.</p>
                    <p>The gestation period of a ewe 140 to 150 days (21 to 22 weeks). 
                        On the average the gestation period in sheep is about 5 months. 
                        With this it is possible for an ewe to give birth at least once a 
                        year or thrice in two years. <b><i>The act of giving birth in sheep is called “lambing”.</i></b></p>

                        The remaining animals may be categorized either as fatteners or growers. 
                        Fatteners are often given bulk feeding to assist in fast weight gain for slaughtering. 
                        They  are usually kept in a pen or restricted paddocks. 
                        The growers are also kept and reared together. 
                        In this case the male must have been castrated and reared for meat.</p>

                <h3>Lambering</h3>
                <p>Lambing is defined act of giving birth in sheep in sheep. 
                    Ewes demonstrate essentially the same characteristics when giving birth. 
                    Towards the end of pregnancy the udder of the animal swells and becomes larger. 
                    The ewe becomes restless bleats and there is a hollow appearance on the flank region of the loin. 
                    Some watery discharge that is opaque  and yellowish is observed from the vulva and the animal choose 
                    a secluded place to give  birth. Parturition process is completed within two hours. 
                    The animal could be assisted if in distress or invite a veterinarian especially if the  
                    foetus position is abnormal. The normal position is when the lamb or kid comes out with 
                    head rested on the fore leg coming out first from the vagina. The dam cleans up the lamb or 
                    kid by licking the mucus from the body and stimulates the lungs to respire in some cases. 
                    The young animal after some time begin to show signs of hunger and thereafter sucks the dam.</p>

                <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
                <h2>Dry period (period between weaning to gestation)</h2>
                    <p>This usually last about three months. The ewe is least productive 
                        at this period. It is a time the dam recovers from the stress of the
                         previous pregnancy and lactation. It is also a  time when the dam
                         prepares for the nest pregnancy period; ewe should be given a higher 
                        plane of nutrition. Flushing results in a higher lambing percentage. 
                        For mating the ratio of ram to ewes is 1:20-40. Hand service 
                        (isolating females on heat and introducing them to males) can increase 
                        the number of females to 50 under intensive management.</p>

                            This period is about five months. Foctal development in the first three months 
                            of pregnancy is normally slow hence to make appreciable increases in feed supply.

             <p>Sheep are gregarious that is they prefer to cluster together. 
                The tendency of these animals to cluster together facilities their management 
                and makes it easy to discover any abnormalities in the flock: sick animals often withdraw or lag behind. 
                For better performance of sheep the following management practices should be undertaken.</p>

                <h2>Castration</h2>
                    <p>Castration can be defined as the careful removal of the testes in the male animal. 
                        Ram lambs not needed for  breeding should be castrated at one or two months of  age. 
                        The purpose of this is to make the animal grow fatty and be more useful and more economically acceptable. 
                        Ram lambs are castrated to stimulate growth and improve meat  quality. Castration should be performed by an 
                        experienced breeder husbandman or a livestock farmer. 
                        Emasculator, burdizzo and elastor band are equipment used for castration.</p>

                    <h2>Dehorning or Disbudding</h2>
                        <p>This is the removal of horn. 
                            The essence of this is to give the animal fitness 
                            reduce the incidence of injury allow more animals be kept
                             in a space and to  allow the animal to grow. The procedure involves destroying
                             the area of epidermal growth after one or two days after birth with caustic paste. 
                            Surgical removal involves the use of scoop. This equipment is used to clip the area after disinfecting.
                             If  encaustic paste (sodium hydroxide or NaOH) or caustic paste is used then the ram lamb should be 
                            restricted for half an hour so that it does not rub the caustic paste off. Fully  grown horns can be removed by 
                            clipping them from
                             young animals or by sawing them in mature animals in both cases local anaesthesia is applied. </p>

                    <h2>Deworming</h2>
                        <p>Deworming is the process of removing worms from the internal environment of the animals using chemicals. 
                            Some of these worms include flukeworm hookworm roundworms pinworms tapeworms and so on. Chemicals used 
                            for deworming often referred to as 
                            dewormer include thiabendazole, banmith, phenothiazine, febendazole, coopane, piperazine, flukazole.</p>
                        <p>Deworming can be done through drenching. 
                            Deworming should be periodically (usually four times in a year) to eliminate worm infestation. 
                            Good hygiene and cleanliness should be maintained on the farm 
                            in order to prevent worm infestation. Rotational grazing must also be practiced.</p>

                        <p>Insects, ticks, mites and lice are all ectoparasites since they live on the outside
                             of the bodies of the animals. These parasites can cause direct harm like the blood
                             sucking insects and ticks which may or may not transmit diseases. Biting flies like 
                            tabanid can make the animals restless and prevent them from grazing properly. 
                            Mites and lice causes extreme irritation in sheep and leads to losses of hides and 
                            skin in sheep while common housefly is a carrier of a number of 
                            bacterial infections including anthrax.</p>
                        <p>Tick causes a number  of diseases which are of economic importance in west Africa. 
                            These include red or heart water disease (babesiosis), gale sickness (amplsmosis), spirochactosis. 
                            Ticks may also transmit mechanically the disease known as kirchi (skin streptothricosis). 
                            Spraying should be done to eliminate these pests. This is done by spraying the animal with insecticidal 
                            chemicals or by forcing animal to pass through a pool of water to which some chemicals have been added. 
                            There is also topical application of this chemical to the back of the animals. </p>
                        <p>This operation should be carried out fortnightly in the rainy season and monthly in the dry season. 
                            Some of these chemicals include vetox 55, toxaphane, bayticool, asuntol, lindane.
                             Ivomee an injectable chemical can be used to cure both ectogparasite and endoparasite at the same time.</p>

                        The  placenta is retained and is brown in colour. 
                        The ewe usually has a vaginal discharge Abortion occurs during 
                        the last four weeks of gestation. There is now a vaccine killed bacterin). 
                        In case of an outbreak antibioties help but the low incidence lessens its practicability.</p>

                <h2>Pragency Disease</h2>
                    <p>Pregnancy disease is an upset or interference in the metabolism eycle of 
                        carbohydrates it is not related in any way to the amount of exercise the ewe gets. 
                        In converting fatty acids and  particularly body fat to glucose ketones accumulate 
                        in the bloodstream and blood glucose levels deeline. The ketones are very toxic to the ewe. 
                        Thus resulting to death within two - five days. Pregnancy disease occurs only 
                        among ewes carrying multiple fetuses and usually only during the last four-five weeks of gestation.</p>
                    <p>The  ewe stops eating which reduces her source  of carbohydrate. 
                        She separates from the flock often wanders aimlessly and may press her head 
                        against-the barn-or-feedbunk. Unless a ewe is treated very soon after the first signs 
                        are noticed little can be done. Separate her from the flock drench her with half
                          pint propylene glycol twice a day until she eats and offer her grain and hay. 
                        Drenching with glucose honey or molasses or injecting 40-50cc of 5 10% glucose under the 
                        skin also may be used with reasonable success. 
                        If the ewe is not treated the first day however the prognosis is poor.</p>
                    <p>To prevent pregnancy disease keep ewes gaining weight during the last four weeks 
                        of gestation. Increase the energy intake by feeding in addition to hay 5 1.0 pound 
                        grain per ewe daily . fat ewes may be more susceptible  because they have difficulty increasing  
                        in weight have limited
                         feed capacity in relation to their size and have an abundant amount of fat-to-convert-to-energy.</p>

                <h2>Mastitis</h2>
                    <p>Mastitis (acute pasteurella) is the major reason producers cull ewes. 
                        Mastitis is associated with lambs with sore mouth and incurred “drying up” 
                        of the ewe at weaning. The teat is too big or is near the ground and the lamb doesn’t find it. 
                        Minimize re infection by  isolating the infected ewe and her lambs. Palpate udders in the fall 
                        and cull ewes with indications of sear tissue. Mark infected ewes at lambing time. Avoid udder 
                        injury and cull ewes with pendulous udders. Treatment includes giving sulfamethazine at one grain 
                        per pound of body weight (two bolus) 
                        intramammary infusion of the udder (by a teat tube) or intramuscular injection of 8 10cc of tetracycline.</p>

                <h2>Foot Rot</h2>
                    <p>Footrot is a grievous disease that almost defies curing. For a small flock of grade ewes selling 
                        out and starting over is the wisest decision. Footrot is eaused by two bacteria. Fusobacterium 
                        necrophorum and Bacteroides nodosus that act synergistically. F necrophorum is common in most manure 
                        it is very hardy and can live for years in manure. It contributs to footrot in cattle and  causes thrush in horses. B. 
                        nodosus-apparently lives only in sheep hooves. It dies out in soil in two weeks it grows very slowly so the incubation 
                        period may be long. Foot abscess may be caused by B. nodosus but footrot requires the presence of both B. nodosus and F.
                         necrophorum. 
                        Moist soil conditions contribute greatly to the cause and spread of footrot.</p>
                    <p><i>To-control-and-treat-footrot:</i>Trim the hoof wall to the quick in all sheep. Soak affected hooves for five minutes in a foot bath containing 90% water and 10% formalin (37% formaldehyde) or 10% zine sulfate. Zine sulfate is as effective as formalin and is safer to-use. Isolate limpers and repeat one week later. Turn apparently cured sheep into an uncontamainated area. Doing so does create a problem however because some sheep thought to be clean actually still are finfected. With time and moist conditions. They will reinfect other sheep. Re-examine all sheep and remove any limpers you initially thought were clean. Force sheep to move through a 10% zine sulfate solution daily for 30 days. This has become the most-successful-treatment-scheme. Sell-persistent-limpers.
                         If you sell all sheep wait three weeks-before-bringing-in-new-sheep.</p>

                <h2>Signs of Good Health</h2>
                    <p>There are a number of clinical sings which an animal attendant can look for which 
                        can give an indication of the health status of his herd. A healthy animal is one 
                        whose body process  function properly so that it can live an active life grow steadily
                         reproduce and attain the maximum level of production of which it is genetically capable.</p>
                    <h3>Attension to Surroundings</h3>
                    <p>A health animal shows interest in its surroundings. It is always ready to take flight if  worried by anything that happens.</p>
                    <h3>Good Appetites</h3>
                    <p>Healthy animals have good appetites both on a pasture where it actively looks for its food and in the house where it quickly consumes 
                        the food given to it ruminants chew the end normally. A first sign if illness is refusal to eat.</p>
                    <h3>Animal Posture and Appearance</h3>
                    <p>A healthy animal carries its head high and is alert. 
                        Dejected appearance are indications that all is not well with an animal.</p>
                    <h3>Absence of Discharge</h3>
                    <p>Health animals do not have any discharge. The eyes are dry and clear no nasal discharges or 
                        inflamed (swollen) running eyes.</p>
                    <h3>Maintaince of Weight</h3>
                    <p>Healthy adult animals should maintain their weight and young animals increase their body weight. 
                        Animals showing obvious loss of body weight are probably unwell.</p>
                    <h3>Normal Breathing</h3>
                    <p>Breathing should not be too rapid or erratic and it should be noiseless continuous 
                        or intermittent coughing shows that there is an irritation in the respiratory tract.</p>
                    <h3>Fairly constant Body Tempreture</h3>
                    <p>The internal body temperatures of healthy animals remain fairly constant at levels which vary
                         according to species that of sheep goats and cows range between 38.50c- 390c. temperatures may
                         however be raise by execration 
                        particularly in hot weather and by fear but disease is the principal cause of a rise temperature.</p>

                        <h3>High Tempreture</h3>
                        <p>Any temperature above 39.50c should be considered an indicative  of disease probably infectious disease.</p>
                        <h3>Lack of Apetite</h3>
                        <p>Animal shows no interest in feed.</p> 
                        <h3>Congestion of Mucosa Around The Eyes</h3>
                        <p>This congestion if often accompanied by weeping sometimes it appears pale
                             or white in the case of anaemia it may be yellowish in colour.</p>
                        <h3>Running Nostrils</h3>
                        <p>This usually occurs with discharge of a purulent blood stained liquid. 
                            Nasal discharge is often accompanied by coughing.</p>
                        <h3>Diarrea</h3>
                        <p>This can easily be detected because the animals hindquarters and are dirty with swollen left flank.</p>
