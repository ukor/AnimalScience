            <p>Many parts of the tropics have long periods when little or no rain falls consequently vegetations 
                dies back and surface water disappears. The quantity of the vegetation also declines, with the 
                best being eaten first. The longer the dry period lasts the poorer the quality of the roughage 
                becomes. Goats will then eat less of this material. If the nutrients in the feed are less than 
                required for an animalâ€™s maintenance it will begin to lose weight as body reserves are depleted.
As this happens the females will become anoestrus and so not breed. Nannies that are already pregnant will produce
                 very weak kids. In very long dry seasons animals will die, with the youngest, weakest and oldest dying first.
	
Goat keepers may counter these adverse effects by feeding goats on tree leaves or legumes. This practice
                 can lead to deforestation problems when many animals are kept. This has happened in some
                 areas of the third world such as Nepal and the Sahel region of Africa. Goats are selective
                 and agile feeders. They will walk long way searching for feed and are happier having a range
                 of vegetation available to them including trees, shrubs and grasses. Shoots and leaves are 
                preferred to stem. In intensive unit, if not managed effectively, goats will refuse and spoil 
                a high percentage of forage offered. When goats are first let out on to pastures in the mornings 
                they will initially graze unselectively but then start to wander and become increasingly selective.
                 Unlike sheep, goats will scatter and graze and browse individually, climbing trees or standing on
                 their hind legs to browse at higher levels. They will stop grazing if disturbed, for example, by rain.
                 In hot conditions goats favour grazing in the early morning and evening. In Arabia they will graze at
                 night if allowed, preferring to seek out comfortable shade during the heat of the day.
Where goat keepers can control their animals under extensive system they may be able to use range better if they allow 
                sheep and goats to graze together. These two species are complementary in habit which means more animals 
                may be kept in a set area. The sheep will graze the lower grasses whilst the goats will browse shrubs and trees.

Good goat keepers will know the browsing habits and movement patterns of the flock and their favourite watering and 
                sheltering spots. They will allow natural resting times in the middle of a day and know when to move 
                the flock. Goats are much more difficult to move during cold, wet or windy periods. Goats change their 
                feeding habit between seasons. In the dry season they will eat bushes and trees which in wetter periods 
                they would ignore, preferring in this season grasses and legumes. They can distinguish bitter, sweet, 
                salty and sour tastes and show tolerance to bitter and salty tastes.

Although goats do not flock together in the way that sheep do, they do have a good herd instinct and if handled
                 frequently become used to being moved or herded in large groups. Calling to animals in specific
                 sound or tonation when feeding, will teach them to move together for handling. Identifying the
                 dominant females and males whom others will follow can also be useful.
