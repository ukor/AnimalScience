       <h3>2.3.1 Feeding</h3>
        <p>Sheep must be adequately fed for optimum performance. Poor feeding is one of the major factors limiting productivity. Essentially, feeds contain energy, protein, fibre, minerals, vitamins and water. Energy is present in feedstuffs in the form of carbohydrates, fats and oils. An animal must have sufficient energy to maintain its body functions and produce meat and milk. Grains, molasses and brewers dried grains are good sources of energy. Proteins are essential for the repair of worn out tissues and the building of new ones. Young and nursing (milking) animals in particular need proteins. Oil seed cakes wheat offal and legume hays (harawa) are good sources of protein.

Fibre is made up of cellulose. High fibre feeds are commonly known as roughages .Ruminants extract energy from fibrous feeds. Minerals and vitamins are essential for body functions and health of animals. Although all feedstuffs contain some amount of minerals and vitamins nevertheless mineral salt licks, bone meal and local rock salts are major sources of these nutrients and should be added to locally compounded feeds. Water is essential for the maintenance of body temperature and functions therefore water must always be available to animals.

The most commonly available feedstuffs for livestock in Nigeria are roughages (grasses legumes, browse plants and crop residues), oil seed cakes (cottonseed cake, groundnut cake and palm kernel cake), molasses wheat offal rice bran, dust (local bran) and brewers dried grains. Roughage is the cheapest feed for sheep being ruminants this can be derived from rangelands (natural vegetation), sown pastures fallow lands and crop residues. For an intensive sheep production system, pasture establishment is a good investment, as a well-established and well managed pasture will provide good quality feed (fresh grasses and legumes or hay). This will considerably reduce the amount of concentrate supplements and hence the production cost. A well established and well-managed pasture can support 25 to 40 sheep per hectare under grazing in the wet season and 5 to10 sheep per hectare in the dry season. The quality of pasture deteriorates considerably during the dry season, often requiring supplementation with concentrate feed.

The amount of concentrate to be utilised will largely depend on the quality and quantity of roughage available. A rule of thumb guide is to allow the animals to graze for at least 6 hours daily or be given 1.5 kg of good quality hay per head per day. In addition, the animals should each receive 0.2 to o.5 kg concentrate supplement per day. Ewes in late pregnancy and nursing animals should receive the higher level of concentrate. Concentrate feeds for ruminants are now marketed country-wide in 25 or 50 kg bags. It may however be cheaper to compound your own concentrate feeds. Examples of 3 formulated rations are given in the section on feedlot fattening of sheep.

Sheep require two to six litres of water per day, depending on age, physiological status, and type of feed and ambient temperature. Both water and mineral salt licks should always be available to the animals.

    <h3>2.3.2 Housing, Equipment and Other Facilities</h3> 
        <p>Housing is an essential requirement for intensive sheep production. Apart from providing overnight shelter and security for the animals it also provides protection against rain and cold. Housing also enhances close supervision of the flock. In short, provision of housing leads to an overall improvement in the performance of the animals. 

Sheep houses need not be elaborate and can vary in type from a low mud-wall building with thatched roof, through corrugated iron walled building, to brick or block housing. Such housing should be located on well-drained soil and should be well ventilated to avoid dampness. The floor can be cemented or made of rammed earth. The floor should be easy to clean and should be covered with suitable bedding material such as straw or wood shavings, which can be changed from time to time.

The building may be divided into pens. Floor space requirements for lambs and adult sheep are about 0.4 and 1.7 m2 respectively. In addition, floor space should be provided for feed and water troughs. There should be a minimum of three pens, one each for male and female sheep, and a sick pen. Ideally there should be more pens per building or more than one building, with separate one for males, females and weaners.

A store and a hay barn could form part of the building. Alternatively, the hay barn could be a separate structure. A run (enclosure) made of chain link wire, waist-high, may be constructed in front of the pens, divided into at least two sections for males and females if housed in different pens in a single building.
Water supply can be from a well, tap, and bore hole or river. It should be clean and in sufficient quantity.
Feed and water troughs should be provided in every pen, either built-in or moveable type. A rectangular feed trough measuring 4 x 0.3 x 0.15 m is adequate for 10 adult sheep. Simple feed troughs could be made by cutting a drum lengthwise into two halves. If cut drums are used, the edges should be made blunt to avoid injuries to the animals. Large plastic basins are better as water troughs as age unlike metal drums they do not corrode.

A foot-bath is required for the prevention and treatment of foot-rot, a very common problem with sheep on wet grounds. The most common type is the walk-through type which is a shallow, long receptacle. Where a small number of sheep is involved, a bucket of basin may be used. 

A dip is an essential structure in a sheep farm. The walk-in, short-swim type is the most common. In this type, the animal enters the vat through a walk- down ramp into a deep section of the vat which contains the dipping solution, and swims out. Dip vats are best made with concrete. A vat measuring 6 x 1.2 x 0.75m has a capacity of about 2000 litres. It is necessary to put a roof over the vat to prevent rain from diluting the chemical. In small-sized flocks, a 200-litre drum opened at one end can be used. The animals are immersed, one at a time, in the dipping solution contained in the drum for about 30 seconds. A knapsack sprayer can also used.
