            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> People keep rabbits for many different reasons. The main aim of this
booklet is to give some reasons for small farmers, low income families
or children to do so, and to discuss management, breeding, nutrition,
veterinary, and other problems for this type of backyard farming.</p>
            
            <ol data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
                <li data-role="list-divider"><h1>Reasons For Rearing Rabbits</h1></li>
            <li>The meat is tasty, good quality and similar to chicken meat. This is
known in many rural, tropical communities.</li>
                <li>There are few religious or other taboos on rabbit meat (except in
vegetarian cultures). Islam does not prohibit eating rabbit meat, for
example.</li>
                <li>Initial capital outlay is minimal. With some scrap wood or bamboo,
a hutch can be constructed.</li>
                <li>Animals all over the tropical world are often used as a savings account.
When a small amount of money is needed it is easier to sell a
small animal than for example the hind leg of a goat.</li>
                <li>The quantity of meat provided by a rabbit is big enough for a small
party or a family dish (comparable to the size of a chicken). On the
other hand a rabbit is small enough to eat all the meat at once without
the need for refrigeration or other conservation.</li>
                <li>To start a rabbit business one does not need a large initial investment.
A few does (females) with a ram or buck (male) is enough to
start, once the kindling begins the herd rapidly increases in size (if
done well and with no bad luck) so that very soon one can slaughter
the young males.</li>
                <li>If one starts a rabbit business with borrowed animals, within half
a year the initial credit can be returned as live animals.</li>
                <li>Because the does produce offspring regularly they form a regular
source of income instead of a large amount at once.</li>
                <li>Feeding rabbits can be very cheap. Even though supplementation
with concentrate or grain is sometimes necessary and definitely will increase growth rates, roadside grass, kitchen offal, garden leaves,
etc. can provide the main feed at almost no cost.</li>
                <li>Rabbits can be tended by women, children or men and unlike bigger
animals need no force to be restrained.</li>
                <li>The manure can be used for vegetable growing.</li>
                <li>The manure does not smell too much, and rabbits do not make
much noise therefore the neighbours will not complain.</li>
                <li>The skin is valuable if there is a market for it, possibly in local
handicrafts (see Chapter 10 for tanning)</li>
                <li>A rabbit is a nice present for a child on a birthday, for a neighbour
who will marry or for a servant who wants to go home to his village.</li>
                
            </ol>
            <p>No doubt this long list could be extended to include many more reasons
for keeping rabbits.</p>
           
            
            <h3>Difficulties of Keeping Rabbits</h3>
                
                <p>1. Most important in a situation where one is the first to start with rabbits
is that often people are reluctant to accept something new.
Whereas in Europe and the U.S. there is a well established market
for rabbit meat, in the tropics the market becomes more and more
organized for chickens; there are few countries with a ready market
for rabbit meat. This reduces potential money income, but it should
be no problem where the intention is to raise rabbits as a family enterprise,
mainly to provide meat for the family where the diet may
be lacking in protein.</p>
                <p>2. Diseases are common and unlike chickens, specific rabbit medicines
are not easily available. Moreover veterinarians (even in
Europe and the U.S.) do not usually have much experience in the
diagnosis and treatment of rabbit diseases. On the other hand, with
good hygiene and common sense, added to information found in
this booklet one should not have too many worries about diseases.
Most animals get sick once in a while, and a dead rabbit is less of a
worry than a dead goat or cow.</p>
                <p>3. Keeping rabbits will certainly take up some of your time. In general
it is hard to say how much. It depends on the number of animals
you keep, the housing system and the way you are able to obtain
feed. For example keeping 5 to 10 rabbits will take you about 1 to 2
hours a day for cleaning, managing and feeding.</p>
            <h2>1.2  General husbandry and handling </h2>
            <p>Like all animals, rabbits require proper care if they are to (re)produce
well. Before going to sleep at night one should check them, and during
the day one should keep a close eye on them. It is not enough to see
that the animal is sick, one should learn to see whether the animal will
be sick, it is not enough to see that the doe has made a nest and kindled,
one should know beforehand that she will make a nest and will
kindle. Animals have no holidays, even on Christmas Eve they need
feed, they will kindle during Easter week, or they may get sick during
Idul fitr or Ramadan.</p>
            <p>Those animals you want to use for further breeding should be given
identification (Chapter 9). Keep a close watch on their performance,
do not kill the fast growers but use those for further upgrading your
stock. Separate the males and females that you want to keep at early
time, before they become sexually active (females 4 months, males 2
months later).
Of those animals that you want to sell, males and females should be
separated only if you keep them as long until they become sexually
active. It is better not to put several litters together in one hutch, in
order to prevent fighting. After mating the first time, you should give
the young doe’s separate hutches and then the whole cycle starts again.</p>
