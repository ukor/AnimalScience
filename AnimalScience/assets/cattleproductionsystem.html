        <p>Cattle production under the traditional system is generally associated with the pastoralist transhumance which has developed over the years as an adaptation to environmental and historical factors; it constitutes the main component of cattle production in the country with the pastoral Fulani as the centre of focus. The traditional livestock grazer was faced with the problems of seasonal variations in forage availability, water, disease, social interactions with the arable crop farmers, government taxation demands, and the need to cater for his family. The resulting evolution has led to a range of husbandry practices geared to overcoming these problems, particularly availability of grazing and the need to avoid the tsetse fly transmitting trypanosomiasis.
            
</p>
        <p><em><strong>Classification of Pastoralist:</strong></em> Ethnic, ecological and economic factors all influence ownership and management of cattle, independently and in combination. As a result, there is an almost infinite number of permutations, but four groups can be broadly recognised:</p>
   
       <dl>
            <dt>1.	Nomadic or Fully Mobile Pastoralist</dt>
                <dd>These practice pure transhumance, with no permanent place of residence and no regular cultivation. They and their families move with the herds, generally in a southward direction during the dry season and moving back during the rains. They have average herds of about 80 – 100 head of cattle together with some sheep and goats (20 – 40). In the search for grazing and water, areas of tsetse fly infestation and other diseases are avoided; their movement is also determined by the location of arable farming communities which provide crop residues for grazing, as well as markets for sale of produce and purchase of essential needs.</dd>
            <dt>2.	Semi-Nomadic or Less – Mobile Pastoralists</dt>
                <dd>In contrast have a permanent place of residence where the elderly members of the family stay with some of the stock, such as the Lactating cows. The other stocks are moved away in search of grazing and water for long periods of time during the dry season. They practice some cropping (often hiring outside labour) although livestock remains their most important economic activity. This group generally does not own as many cattle as the former group, but all their other practices are similar. Indeed, it is claimed that this is a transition stage to full sedentarisation.</dd>
            <dt>3.	The Semi – Settled Pastoralist</dt>
                <dd>These have a permanent place of abode and practice some supplementary cultivation for food production. They keep smaller herds and usually only move out in search of grazing and water towards the end of the dry season. They sometimes construct temporary shelters, and grow and harvest crops at the beginning of the rains before moving back to their home base.</dd>
        <dt>4.	Settled Pastoralists</dt>
            <dd>These live continuously in permanent settlements all year round, and practice arable cropping in addition to livestock husbandry. Herds are grazed during the day by children or hired hands and the animals are tethered at night. Some of these look after stock for owners who live in the urban areas.</dd>

      </dl>
        <hr class="break">
        <h3> Pastoralist Management: </h3>
        <p>In order to survive in a purely nomadic system, each unit must control enough livestock to sustain itself. While many forces have led to the continual process of settlement a key factor is herd size which, either due to inheritance or disease may cease to be viable economic unit in its own right so that recourse to cultivation is necessary for survival. However, with allowance made for a total dependence on the proceeds of livestock husbandry and the constraints of perpetual mobility, the husbandry system holds good for both nomadic and settled Fulani.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>The Mobility of Cattle is a Feature of all Extensive Grazing System:</dt>
            <dd>At the extreme the pure nomads may move hundreds of kilometers and stay nowhere more than a few days while for the permanently settled, the grazing zone may be within say five kilometers of the camp. For the latter there are three, albeit indistinct, phases in the year. During the growing season the herds are kept off the crop lands in large units. Immediately after harvest the cattle are put in is graze crop residues; this is often, but not always, by arrangement with the farmers. As the dry season progresses the herds; are progressively subdivided for grazing, smaller units being better able to seek out and utilize small patches of grass, crop residues, etc. in some areas there is a separation of the ‘wet’ animals; (cows and calves) and cows that are in an advanced stage of pregnancy, which are left behind in the ‘Mashekari’ or permanent place of abode while the rest of the herd is moved out in search of feed. The wet herd is grazed in areas like the fadamas (the low plains) that have good dry season supplies of forage and water.

A close examination of the traditional pastoralist system reveals a stronger emphasis of milk production than beef, and the system of management that ensures all year round supply of milk from the herd. Milk is a major source of income for the family’s day to day needs, and women attend markets daily in order to sell the sour milk (nono), butter (mai) along with millet or sorghum ball (fura); the fura is sold with the nono mixed by the vendor and is consumed on the spot. Household heads also attend market regularly and the trading pattern leads to a natural affinity between herd movement and the location of markets and population centres.

In conclusion, it should be stressed that the general concept of the traditional grazier as a nomad who cannot settle is fast disappearing. The picture that now emerges is that between 40 – 50 per cent of traditional
Fulani grazers are settled, another 20 – 30 per cent are estimated to be semi-settled, whilst only about 20 per cent now remain in the traditional nomadic system of production. This is significant for it means that the often stated constraint that normadism has on introducing technology to the cattle industry does not apply to over 50 per cent of cattle owners.
