        <dt>Feeding and Digestion</dt>
            <dd>The first 72 hours after birth are very critical for the baby pig. During this period the colostrums of the sow has a high content of antibodies and the piglet intestine is able to absorb intact proteins. As the piglet has very little of its own resistance to disease, it is essential that it gets a good suck of colostrums and acquires passive immunity from the sow. Failure to take in sufficient colostrums will invariably result in the pig succumbing to infection before it can develop active immunity of its own. Once the piglet has established a teat position, which normally occurs in the first 24 hours after farrowing, it will retain this position for the remainder of the suckling period. As long as milk production continues the dam suckles her litter every 60 to 90 minutes.</dd>
            <dt>Alimentary Canal</dt>
            <dd>Although pigs in tropical regions may eat a lot of fibre they are simple stomached animals and not ruminants which possess a complex stomach with a large microbial population which enables them to digest large quantities of fibrous material. Thus, their ability to digest and utilize fibre is restricted to that digested by the microbial population in the caecum which is of relatively small volume when compared with the rumen. It has been claimed that unimproved breeds found in Africa have an enhanced ability to utilize fibrous feeds compared with exotic breeds. While this may be so to a small extent, there are no anatomical differences of the digestive tract between the two types. Accordingly, with all pigs, high-fibre diets will have the effect of diluting the amount of nutrients available to the animal. In contrast to ruminants, pigs are unable to utilise non-protein sources of nitrogen for the production of microbial protein in the rumen. This makes them dependent on both the amount and quantity of protein in their diet.

The alimentary tract of the pig is designed to digest and absorb concentrate feeds. Feed taken in at the mouth is ground into a pulp by mastication. At the same time it is moistened and mixed with saliva. Saliva contains the enzyme ptyalin which initiates the breakdown of starch to simpler carbohydrates. The feed then passes on into the stomach, which provides an acid environment due to the presence of hydrochloric acid. The gastric juice contains the enzyme pepsin which begins the breakdown of protein. The small intestine is the major site where feed absorption occurs and digestive juices from the pancreas, liver and the small intestine complete the process of digestion as follows. Starch is hydrolyzed to maltose by amylase from the pancreatic juice. Specific enzymes break down maltose and other disaccharide sugars in the intestinal juice, e.g. maltase, lactase and sucrose into monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose. These are then absorbed through the gut wall. Trypsin in the pancreatic juice acts on protein to produce polypeptides, which are then broken down to amino acids by various peptidases in the intestinal juice and subsequently absorbed. Bile, which is secreted by the liver, serves to emulsify fats into smaller globules, which are then broken down by the enzymes lipase into fatty acids and glycerol ready for absorption. Lipase is present in both the pancreatic and intestinal juices.

Pigs are omnivores and will consume a wide range of feeds from both plant and animal sources. The natural inclination of the pig is to eat on a ‘little and often’ basis, and this is likely to maximize both total feed intake and the efficiency of feed utilisation.
</dd>
            <dt>Pig Behaviour and Effect of Climate</dt>
            <dd>Pigs are not solitary animals and will generally benefit from social contact with each other, even if only by sight or smell. At the same time, groups of pigs will always establish a social hierarchy and this starts at birth when the piglet struggles to commandeer a teat position. If strange pigs are penned together later in life, fighting invariably ensues, and this can lead to considerable stress and physical damage to individual pigs. Once settled, however, pigs will huddle together in order to retain body heat in cold weather.

In common with the female of those species, sows are notably more docile during pregnancy than they have just produced young. Just prior to farrowing, the sow will prepare a nest from her bedding. She is often irritable during this period, and if she is confined without access to bedding material, this can lead to stress during the farrowing process. Contrary to popular belief the pig is not a dirty animal and will normally defecate and urinate away from its resting or lying areas. However, this pattern tends to break down if pigs are overcrowded or stressed in other ways. Also, when temperatures are high they will often roll in their own faeces and urine in an attempt to increase evaporation and keep cool.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the interaction between pigs and humans in relation to productivity. If pigs live in fear of their stockman, both growth and reproductively performance are likely to be depressed. In order to cope with forest conditions, the pig has better mechanisms for retaining heat, especially a well-developed subcutaneous fat cover, than for losing heat from the body. Because the pig possesses sweat glands only on the snout, it is unable to dissipate large amounts of heat by sweating. Furthermore, the skin of certain breeds of pigs, e.g. Large White and Landrace, has no protection against the sun, and unless they have access to shade, or mud in which they can wallow, they can become badly sun burnt.

Like man, the pig is a homeotherm, and needs to maintain its deep body temperature constant. Nature has designed the metabolism of the pig to operate most effectively at 39oC. For a certain range of environmental temperature, known as the zone of thermal neutrality the pig finds this easy and can maintain the correct body temperature by varying blood flow to and from the skin. The extent of this zone changes quite markedly according to the weight of the pig.
At the bottom end of this zone a lower critical temperature is reached when the pig required diverting feed energy to increase heat production in order to maintain body temperature. The lower critical temperature will vary between pigs according to a number of factors, for instance how fat (well-insulated) the pig is, how much feed it is eating and therefore how fast it is growing. Whether it has bedding to help prevent heat loss, whether it is in huddle with pen mates, and whether it can make postural changes to minimize heat losses. Eventually, with decreasing ambient temperature the pig can no longer maintain its body temperature in spite of high heat production, and hypothermia and death ensues.

Of greater interest in the tropics is the effect on the pig as ambient temperature rises. When the environmental temperature approaches body temperature, the pig will attempt to increase evaporative heat loss by sweating (through its limited sweat glands), panting, postural and positional changes, and wallowing in water, mud or excrement. In addition, it will reduce its energy output by decreasing its feed intake. However, as the means of dissipating heat in the pig are not very efficient, particularly in the absence of the opportunity to wallow, it will soon reach an upper critical temperature. This is associated with hyperthermia and heat stress and the pig will die if the situation cannot be reversed.

At the other end of the scale, the piglet at birth is particularly sensitive to low ambient temperatures. Pigs are born with virtually no subcutaneous fat cover and limited carbohydrate reserves and therefore at birth they will suffer an immediate drop in body temperature. In the case of weaker piglets they may battle to obtain an adequate milk supply; if they require energy to keep warm they very quickly develop the condition of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and die of cold.

</dd>
            <dt>Stress</dt>
            <dd>From the foregoing it is clear that stress factors can take many forms, and in fact can involve fear, pain, temperature, direct sunlight, restraint, fatigue and interference with natural behaviour patterns. Stress will quickly lead to reduced performance and productivity, and specifically to gastric ulcers (just as in humans), greater susceptibility to infectious diseases and higher mortality rates. It is therefore paramount that we understand what constitutes the major stress factors in pigs in different circumstances so that production systems can be designed to minimize these effects.

</dd>
            <dt>Housing</dt>
            <dd>The most productive pigs are likely to be those contained in a thermally neutral environment; that is, when the environmental temperature around the pig is insistently between the pig’s lower critical temperature (LCT) and upper critical temperature (UCT). The pig’s metabolic heat production is then at a minimum, and it is neither using feed energy to keep warm, nor reducing feed intake to keep cool.

        <p>Other considerations for pig comfort and well–being in addition to temperature are:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Protection from other climatic extremes such as direct sun, wind and rain</li>
        <li>Provision of dry conditions which are hygienic and do not predispose the pig to disease</li>
        <li>Allowing, as far as possible, for inherent behavior patterns of the pig, and minimizing the effect of social dominance</li>
            <li>Provision of accessible feed and clean water</li>
            <li>Providing conditions so that good stockman can practice</li>
            <li>Effective disposal of effluent.
