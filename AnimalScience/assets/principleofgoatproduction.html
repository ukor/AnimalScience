            <dt>Feed and Feeding</dt>
            <dd>Goats are animals known to convert low quality fibrous vegetation into useful products for man. These include meat, milk, skin and manure. Goats prefer a varied diet and to be able to wander and browse a broad range of plants. In traditional systems they make good use of the available vegetation. Because of their browsing habit they are often able to exist in areas of low rainfall and poor growth, where cattle and even sheep would not prosper. If their numbers do not become excessive, a good ecological balance can be maintained. Goats, being inquisitive eaters, will eat all types of vegetation as well asarticles which have little feed value, such as cardboard and human hairs.

However, given the opportunity, they seek good pasture where they can	select the grasses they prefer. They will often reject the legume clover which is favoured by sheep and cattle. This means that combining sheep and goats to graze in a single flock does not necessarily lead to competition between the two species. Where a wide range of plants is available it is possible to keep more animals on a given area of land because each species grazes on a different type of vegetation.

Goats are ruminants. This means they have four – stomach digestive system which comprises rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum in the adult goat with which they extract nutrients from fibrous materials using bacteria and protozoa that live in the rumen and reticulum. Feed is initially chewed in the mouth and mixed with saliva before it passes to rumen. This material is returned to mouth for further chewing so that the particle size is reduced, speeding up subsequent digestion. This regurgitation is called chewing the cud. Like all ruminants goats can be seen chewing and re- chewing this material between grazing periods. They chew the cud more at night than during the day. After thoroughly chewing cud the feed passes to rumen and reticulum, where microorganism break it into simple chemicals which are either absorbed into the body or are used by the micro –organism to reproduce. The populations of micro-organisms break it into simple chemicals which are either absorbed into the body or are used by micro –organism found in the gut. Digestive microbes are specific to particular diets and gradually change in response to changes in the types of feed being eaten. If a sudden change of diet occurs the system is upset because the microorganisms cannot digest the new feeds. It takes days for the appropriate micro-organism populations to build up to cope with the new diet. The sudden introduction of a new feed can lead to scouring and loss of condition or even death in severe cases. For goat keepers, this means that any change in diet must be very gradual. A new feed should be given in very small amounts at first, with the quantity being increased progressively over a period of days. The liquid mixture of rumen and reticulum passes to the omasum, where most of the water removed, and then to the abomasums. This stomach is very acidic and any micro-organism reaching it is killed. Digestion from this point progresses with the addition of enzymes which are secreted from the gut wall. The digestive contents are now broken down into nutrients that are useful to the body. These are absorbed by the small intestine. This part of the gut is very long but is accommodated as a series of coils so it takes up as little room as possible. More of the water is removed in the large intestine before the very dry dung pellets are expelled from the rectum through the anus. Goats are able to extract almost all of the water from the contents of the digestive system, which means they can make very efficient use of whatever water is available. This is one of the reasons why goats can survive in arid regions. It is considered a sign of good health if the dung is reasonable dry.

            <p class="dt">Feed Intake</p>
            <p class="dd">In the tropics, dairy goats will eat up to the equivalent of 4-5 per cent of their own body weight in dry matter daily. Meat goats will consume about three per cent. In cooler parts of the world dairy goats have been known to eat up to eight per cent. Goats have a much better capacity for forage than sheep of a similar size. How much a goat eats depends on its:
                </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Age</li>
                <li>Breed</li>
                <li>Prooduction capacity, or</li>
                <li>Whether is pregnant or lactating</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="dd">    Younger goats eat more than older ones because they are growing. Pregnant and lactating animals consume more than non-pregnant and non-lactating ones because they need more feed to produce milk and to enable the foetus to grow. Goats with free access to feed will vary their intake depending on the energy available from the feed. One average bigger goats eat more than smaller ones. All goats will eat more if the feed is in a fine rather than coarse form. The goat keeper can influence how much goats eat by: 
              </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>How finely ground the feed is; and</li>
                    <li>How much useful energy the feed has (measure in ME per kg DM)</li>

                </ul>
               <p class="dd">       If hay or straw is chopped, more will be eaten than if fed without chopping. Finely chopped straw is often fed as part of a concentrate ration. More feed is eaten if the feed has a high energy density. So if a high-energy feed such as or molasses is mixed with a fibrous feed such as straw, goats will eat more. Feed intake is generally measured in dry matter terms. Dry matter (DM) is the amount of feed remaining when all the water has been removed. It is used as a guide to how much fresh or moist feed can be fed.

All goats have a basic need (maintenance) for energy nutrients but some will also require additional (production) nutrients at particular times, for example, nannies in the final stages of pregnancy or when lactating or kids when they are growing. The energy from feed is used by the goat for maintenance. Maintenance energy is that amount needed to maintain the animal in a stable body condition and provide enough energy for walking. Production is that required for growing and for producing milk or a foetus. It is required over and above the energy for maintenance. Not all energy in feed can be used by the goat and so only the part that, the metabolisable energy (ME) part, is used to calculate how much energy is needed for a goat’s
maintenance and production. Energy is measure in Mega joules (MJ) or calories. (One calories = 4.2joules). An average diet contains about 8.5 Mega joules (MJ) of  Metabolisable Energy (ME) per kilogram of dry matter (DM). However, the amount may range from 6 to 13 MJ/ME/kg DM.

All goats should have a minimal level of crude protein each day. Crude protein (CP) is calculated from the nitrogen content of a feed.
1. CP = nitrogen x 6.25 (It is expressed as a percentage (%))
Protein can also be synthesized from non-protein nitrogen such as urea. The crude protein content of a feed is calculated in the laboratory and, in temperate countries, tables are available showing values for many feeding materials. This is infuriately, not the case with most tropical feedstuffs. Much less is known about specific protein requirements for goats in the tropics. 
So if a very high fibrous diet (e.g. straw) is fed it may be low in protein. Additional crude protein,  such as fish or oilseed meals, should then be added to the feed as a supplement.
A 35-40 kg doe requires about 30g/day DCP (Digestible crude protein) for maintenance. For pregnancy and lactation this rises to 70g/day. For growing kids the requirements vary with size of kid and daily rate of growth. A 10 kg kid gaining 100g/day would need some 30g DCP whilst one at 30g would need 50g/day.
In many situations goats do not suffer from a lack of vitamins where they have access to pasture or rangeland. Most diets have sufficient vitamin A (carotene), Vitamins D and K if green vegetation is available. If vitamin B12 is deficient, as characterized by anemia, loss of appetite and poor growth goats should be given cobalt, which will assist intestinal micro flora to synthesis the vitamin. Vitamin C does not need to be added to the diet as the goat is able to synthesize sufficient for its needs.
Minerals are important in the diet to keep goats healthy. There are two groups of minerals. Macro mineral nutrients (major) are in relatively large amounts while micro minerals (minor) are needed in very small quantities. The minerals needed in goat diets are given below:

            <p class="dt">Supplementation</p>
            <p class="dd">Most farmers in the tropics cannot afford to give their goats any feed over and above what the animals can graze. By being able to select particular plants, goats may be able to increase the quality of their diet, especially with regard to energy or protein levels. In practice, their diet consists almost entirely of low-valve roughages. In these situations feeding a supplement to the diet can have a dramatic effect on productivity especially during the dry season, during late pregnancy or where animals are still fed.
                <p>Supplement can be given as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>concentrate containing extra energy(molasses, cereals)</li>
                <li>Protein source (legumes)</li>
                <li>Non-protein nitrogen</li>
                <li>Minerals/ vitamins(salt licks).</li>

            </ul>
                <p class="dd">      Supplementary feeding is a costly exercise and only worthwhile if the improvement in performance gained it greater than the cost. If feeding pregnant nannies in the final month of gestation gives larger kids that grow well and can be sold for higher prices then supplementation may be worth doing. This is especially so if the supplementation is cheap to obtain. Tree fodder is one example and agricultural by-products may be the other.

            </p>
            <p class="dt">Practical feeding</p>
            <p class="dd">In practical terms the following period are important ones to consider when feeding goats:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Bucks and nannies 1 month before mating</li>
<li> Nannies for the 3 weeks after mating</li>
<li> Nannies the final month before kidding</li>
<li> First 2 months of lactation</li>
<li>Growing kids, especially post weaning.
</li>
            </ul>
    <p class="dd">            Only in selected situations are concentrates likely to be either available or given as a supplement. More likely supplements are legumes or crop residues. These might include leucaena, stylos, pigeon peas, sweet potato stems/leaves, groundnut haulm and cassava leaves.

When not being used for mating, bucks do not normally need supplementary feed. A small quantity of concentrate in the 3-4 week period before breeding will help build up body condition of bucks. This is important if the males have many nannies to mate or if climatic conditions are harsh. Bucks can lose a great deal of weight during the mating period.

Feeding nannies immediately before and for three weeks after mating keeps them in good condition and will help the implantation of fertilized eggs in the uterus. By far the most critical period during which correct feeding is important for the nanny is the last month of pregnancy when the foetuses are growing very rapidly and causing a severe strain on the mother’s body reserves. Reducing the ration immediately after kidding and then building it up again for the first three weeks of the lactation until weaning, will encourage good milk production.
If nannies are in very poor condition at weaning, supplementary feeding will enable them to regain body condition and to be in a good state for mating and conception. It is hard to justify the cost of feeding kids concentrates. Supplementary feeding of kids after weaning will stop them losing weight that often occurs when the nannies’ milk is no longer available to them.
