            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> People keep rabbits for many different reasons. The main aim of this
booklet is to give some reasons for small farmers, low income families
or children to do so, and to discuss management, breeding, nutrition,
veterinary, and other problems for this type of backyard farming.</p>
            <h3>Reasons For Rearing Rabbits</h3>
            <ol>
                
            <li>The meat is tasty, good quality and similar to chicken meat. This is
known in many rural, tropical communities.</li>
                <li>There are few religious or other taboos on rabbit meat (except in
vegetarian cultures). Islam does not prohibit eating rabbit meat, for
example.</li>
                <li>Initial capital outlay is minimal. With some scrap wood or bamboo,
a hutch can be constructed.</li>
                <li>Animals all over the tropical world are often used as a savings account.
When a small amount of money is needed it is easier to sell a
small animal than for example the hind leg of a goat.</li>
                <li>The quantity of meat provided by a rabbit is big enough for a small
party or a family dish (comparable to the size of a chicken). On the
other hand a rabbit is small enough to eat all the meat at once without
the need for refrigeration or other conservation.</li>
                <li>To start a rabbit business one does not need a large initial investment.
A few does (females) with a ram or buck (male) is enough to
start, once the kindling begins the herd rapidly increases in size (if
done well and with no bad luck) so that very soon one can slaughter
the young males.</li>
                <li>If one starts a rabbit business with borrowed animals, within half
a year the initial credit can be returned as live animals.</li>
                <li>Because the does produce offspring regularly they form a regular
source of income instead of a large amount at once.</li>
                <li>Feeding rabbits can be very cheap. Even though supplementation
with concentrate or grain is sometimes necessary and definitely will increase growth rates, roadside grass, kitchen offal, garden leaves,
etc. can provide the main feed at almost no cost.</li>
                <li>Rabbits can be tended by women, children or men and unlike bigger
animals need no force to be restrained.</li>
                <li>The manure can be used for vegetable growing.</li>
                <li>The manure does not smell too much, and rabbits do not make
much noise therefore the neighbours will not complain.</li>
                <li>The skin is valuable if there is a market for it, possibly in local
handicrafts (see Chapter 10 for tanning)</li>
                <li>A rabbit is a nice present for a child on a birthday, for a neighbour
who will marry or for a servant who wants to go home to his village.</li>
                
            </ol>
            <p>No doubt this long list could be extended to include many more reasons
for keeping rabbits.</p>
           
            
            <h3>Difficulties of Keeping Rabbits</h3>
                
                <p>1. Most important in a situation where one is the first to start with rabbits
is that often people are reluctant to accept something new.
Whereas in Europe and the U.S. there is a well established market
for rabbit meat, in the tropics the market becomes more and more
organized for chickens; there are few countries with a ready market
for rabbit meat. This reduces potential money income, but it should
be no problem where the intention is to raise rabbits as a family enterprise,
mainly to provide meat for the family where the diet may
be lacking in protein.</p>
                <p>2. Diseases are common and unlike chickens, specific rabbit medicines
are not easily available. Moreover veterinarians (even in
Europe and the U.S.) do not usually have much experience in the
diagnosis and treatment of rabbit diseases. On the other hand, with
good hygiene and common sense, added to information found in
this booklet one should not have too many worries about diseases.
Most animals get sick once in a while, and a dead rabbit is less of a
worry than a dead goat or cow.</p>
                <p>3. Keeping rabbits will certainly take up some of your time. In general
it is hard to say how much. It depends on the number of animals
you keep, the housing system and the way you are able to obtain
feed. For example keeping 5 to 10 rabbits will take you about 1 to 2
hours a day for cleaning, managing and feeding.</p>
            <h2>1.2  General husbandry and handling </h2>
            <p>Like all animals, rabbits require proper care if they are to (re)produce
well. Before going to sleep at night one should check them, and during
the day one should keep a close eye on them. It is not enough to see
that the animal is sick, one should learn to see whether the animal will
be sick, it is not enough to see that the doe has made a nest and kindled,
one should know beforehand that she will make a nest and will
kindle. Animals have no holidays, even on Christmas Eve they need
feed, they will kindle during Easter week, or they may get sick during
Idul fitr or Ramadan.</p>
            <p>Those animals you want to use for further breeding should be given
identification (Chapter 9). Keep a close watch on their performance,
do not kill the fast growers but use those for further upgrading your
stock. Separate the males and females that you want to keep at early
time, before they become sexually active (females 4 months, males 2
months later).
Of those animals that you want to sell, males and females should be
separated only if you keep them as long until they become sexually
active. It is better not to put several litters together in one hutch, in
order to prevent fighting. After mating the first time, you should give
the young doe’s separate hutches and then the whole cycle starts again.</p>

           <p>Just as there are many different types of cattle, it is not surprising to
know that there are many types of rabbits. As with cattle, very often
crosses occur between one race and another (crossbreeds), not to mention
all the local varieties, often called local rabbits, native breeds
and so on. Here breeds will be grouped in two for practical purposes
without trying to make scientifically correct distinctions.</p>
               <h2>2.1  Fancy and fur breeds </h2>
               <p>Fancy and fur breeds differ from meat breeds in that the fancy types
are not necessarily good meat producers, do not have large litters nor
are they resistant/tolerant to diseases. They have nice skins, nice colours,
funny ears and so on.</p>
               <p>One of these types which deserves attention is the angora. The hair
can become very long and provides a very valuable fibre for spinning
and weaving. The value of the angora should not be overlooked for
small home industries even though not much information is available.
The hair seems to grow better in colder climates which might reduce
the value of the angora in the tropical lowlands.
 </p>
               <h2>2.2  Meat breeds </h2>
               <p>Utility breeds are producers of meat, either by a fast growth rate
(needs good feeding) or large and frequent litters. It is necessary to
make a further distinction here in weight:</p>
               <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
               <li>light breeds (up to 2-3 kg adult weight)</li>
                   <li>medium breeds (3-5 kg)</li>
                   <li>heavy breeds (more than 5 kg)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>When choosing the right breed keep a few things in mind:</p>
               <div data-role="collapsible-set">
               <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
               <h2>One should remember that very often local crosses seem to be of
the lighter breeds.</h2>
                   <p>One should remember that very often local crosses seem to be of
the lighter breeds. They may have the genetic potential to grow big
but due to poor feeding, disease, mating too early and too often and
suboptimal care, they do not get the chance to do so.
Before considering nice looking large animals which are imported
one might do well to try the local breeds giving them proper feeding
and care. Imported breeds all too often involve loss of face, prestige,
money and effort because the animals may not grow either under
the poor local circumstances, they are susceptible to diseases,
and they are expensive; the stress of transport will cause diseases
and mortality.</p>
               </div>
                   <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
                   <h2>Even though big animals look nice and impressive it is not always
advantageous to have large animals.</h2>
                       <p>Even though big animals look nice and impressive it is not always
advantageous to have large animals. They mature later so they will
start to produce offspring, let us say, at 9 months whereas the lighter
breeds do so at 6 months. Your choice may be between 3 does of 3
kg producing 3 litters earlier whereas 1 doe of 9 kg (3 x 3 kg) produces
1 litter later. What family can eat 4 kg of meat at once (resulting
from a 9 kg animal).</p>

                   <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
                   <h2>A special word of caution should be made against the Flemish giant.</h2>
                       <p>A special word of caution should be made against the Flemish giant.
It is a very good show animal and does well for public relations
(around 9 kg is not uncommon). But fertility is not very good, litter
size is not high, quite a few disease problems (sore hocks) occur
and it has a lot of bone and intestine compared with medium breeds
like the New-Zealand (white) and the Californian.</p>
                   </div>
                   <p>The important thing is to get rabbit-minded with as little risk as possible.
That does not usually imply the use of expensive, fancy, large
animals.</p>

            <p>When you cannot buy animals from a reliable source and you have to
buy from an unknown person or market there are some things to keep
in mind.</p>
                <div data-role="collapsible-set">
                <div data-role="collapsible">
                <h2>3.1  Health </h2>
                    <p>The animals have to be healthy. The main signs are a smooth skin,
standing ears, clear eyes, quiet breathing, no mange (scabies) forming
crusts around the nose, eyes, at the edges of the ears or inside the ears
as a dirty mass. Put them on the ground and let them jump to watch
for irregular legs, inspect the anus to see whether it is dirty from diarrhoea
(should not be!) which is often the case in young rabbits. Check
the stomach (abdomen) of the animal. It should feel soft but smooth; a
spongy feeling may indicate some intestinal troubles (see Chapter 8 on
sick animals). Watch for sneezing rabbits. Dirty front legs and/or dirty
nose may indicate a coughing disease (pasteurellose), because the
animals wash their nose with their front legs.</p>

                </div>
                    <div data-role="collapsible">
                    <h2>3.2  Sex </h2>
                        <p>The sexing of very young animals is not so easy. The older males have
two big testes. If only one testis shows do not use him for breeding
even though he is fertile, because it is a hereditary defect. If you are
still not sure, which is often the case with young rabbits, hold the rabbit
on its back, put one finger on the tail side of the genital apparatus
and one on the abdominal side. Press down gently and stretch the organ;
if it is a doe a long slit will appear, if it is a buck a small curved
penis will show (figure 2). Do not confuse two small glands about the
size of a pinhead on either side of the sexual organ with the testes. Buying rabbits, sexing and judging their quality can only be learned
by making mistakes first and thereby gathering experience. However,
it is by no means an impossible or difficult task.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div data-role="collapsible">
                    <h2>3.3   Risk</h2>
                        <p>Buying at a market implies risks and no guarantee can be given. A
market is gathering and meeting place for diseases and in general
farmers are unlikely to take their best animals to the market to sell
there. The salesman often does not keep rabbits himself so he is also a
poor adviser, moreover he will not know anything of the history of the
rabbit, or he will only pretend to know. For example if you buy a reasonable-
looking rabbit, who will tell you whether she is pregnant (if
you cannot feel it yourself), whether she is infertile or should be bred,
or whether she is actually still too young to be mated?</p>

        <h2>4.1     Male</h2>
            <p>In males the proper age for the first mating
depends on the breed and individual development. For small breeds it
is 4-5 months, for large breeds 9-12 months. One male can easily handle
up to 10 or more does, but this depends on mating intensity, heat,
stress, age of the male, nutrition and so on. It is not a bad practice to
have two males around because it is easier to prevent inbreeding.</p>
            <p>Another reason is that by breeding in turns you will more easily be
able to detect if the results of one are better than the other. You will
not so easily blame infertility on the does but you can detect the effect
of the male.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the male is given a round hutch/stable so the doe cannot sit
with her hind end in a corner which makes mating a little bit difficult.</p>
        </div>
            <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
            <h2>4.2  The female</h2>
                <p>The female story is not difficult or complicated either, but she does
require more care and attention. Like the males the proper age of first
mating depends on the breed and individual development. Mate females
(does) when they reach 75-80 % of mature body weight (4-5
months of age for the lighter breeds, 7-9 months for the heavy breeds).
Does mature earlier than bucks.</p>
                <p>Rabbits have no clear reproductive cycle. Nevertheless they do exhibit
periods of greater willingness. They do refuse the buck sometimes!
Signs of greater willingness are restlessness, noisiness (she will
scratch the hutch), rubbing her chin on the feeding tray or drinking
dish, the genital area will have a redder colour than usual. To mate the
rabbit you do not have to wait until these signs show; she can be put
with the buck at any time, as the egg will come free after mating.
However, she may not always accept the buck. Does that are maintained in good physical condition should produce litters until they are
2 1/2 to 3 years old.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
            <h2>4.3  Mating of buck and doe</h2>
                <p>Mating should be carried out during the cooler times of the day, early
morning or late afternoon.</p>
                <p>Always bring the doe to the buck and not the other way round. If you
put the buck in the hutch of the doe she is liable to defend her territory
and fighting can start. On the contrary, by bringing her to him she will
smell the male and will not defend the territory. She may do some initial
running around but will eventually accept the buck.</p>
                <p>If she accepts the buck she will sit down in his hutch and raise her rear
end. Mating has taken place when the male falls aside or backwards
after mounting the doe. Often he (and not she) utters a characteristic
cry of pain or pleasure (difficult to make out which!). He may mount
again immediately and mate again as before or he will run around,
stamp his feet, and after some time do it again! If the doe is willing to
be mated, effective mating takes place twice within the first 5-15 minutes.</p>
                <p>After a successful first mating a second is not necessary. The second
mating can even be used for another doe if the buck is very busy. If
the buck does not have too busy a schedule there is of course nothing
against a second time. If the mating was successful put the doe back in
her hutch.</p>
                <p>If the female starts to run or fight it is better to try it again after a few
hours, the next morning or evening. Do not leave the doe with the
buck overnight or for a few days. You will not know then whether
mating actually took place, fighting might injure either the doe or the
buck and stress will be the result. Instead keep watching the mating
without disturbing it.
16 Reproduction
If a buck shows no interest within the first few minutes, it is virtually
no use leaving them together. In this case also try again later.</p>
                <p>What do you do if she does not accept the buck? In the first place she
might be pregnant (see pregnancy-control). She will almost certainly
refuse the buck then, and every time she is bothered it will reduce the
chances of a good litter. In the second place there might be antipathy
between the buck and the doe. In this case try another buck.</p>
                <p>Sometimes it may help to hold the doe while she is in the bucks
hutch. One hand to hold her head and body from running away, the
other hand under her body, raising her hind a little bit, thus initiating a
posture which she should naturally or automatically take. Matings can
be successful this way but probably are not as good as spontaneous
matings.</p>
                <p>If none of these suggestions work, you may want to use her for meat.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
            <h2>4.4  Pregnancy-control </h2>
                <p>A week or two after mating you will notice that the doe has become
quieter, seems to eat less, and sits with her abdomen resting nicely on
the floor. She will start pulling out her hair to make a nest at about 30-
32 days after mating, soon followed by producing a litter. Sometimes
she fails to produce a litter after making a nest. If this happens approximately
2 weeks after mating it is called pseudo-pregnancy. Dont
be disappointed. This is a perfect time to breed her, she is willing and
fertile right at the time of pseudo-pregnancy.</p>
                <p>To check sooner whether the mating was successful you will have to
check for pregnancy. Pregnancy-control requires some practice but
there are some fairly clear signs. Her hair can easily be pulled out if
she is pregnant (later on she will make the nest with her own hair
which she pulls with her mouth from her body). During the last days
of pregnancy the teats become harder and somewhat red, and the udder
will then begin to swell.</p>
                <p>The best method of checking is palpation, but this requires practice.
Palpation is possible from 10 days and onwards after mating. Place the
doe facing you on a table, a bench or the floor. Put both hands on the
sides and a little under the belly, gently pressing them towards each
other and upwards. Of course you can feel a lot in the belly. Amongst
others, right behind the left ribs you can feel the liver; all the way up
in the abdomen on both sides and just under the spine, halfway back
you will feel the kidneys. You may also feel the small faecal pellets
and the guts. If she is pregnant after two weeks you will start to feel
hard things like marbles, also in the upper side of the abdomen. These
become progressively larger until you might even be able to feel the
form of an embryo. Do not worry if you cannot feel all these things at
first. After some practice you will be able to identify the embryos with
little effort.</p>
                <p>If this sounds too difficult it is also possible to check for pregnancy by
putting the doe with the buck again 12 days after mating. If she refuses,
the first mating has almost certainly worked out well. If she is
willing again, the buck can repeat his work. This method has the very
small risk that an already pregnant doe gets mated again with the possibility
of starting another pregnancy halfway through the first. This
super-pregnancy occurs occasionally.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
            <h2>4.5  Kindling and mothercare</h2>
                <p>When the doe is almost ready for kindling (about 4 weeks after mating)
you can put a nest box in the maternity cage (for designs see
Chapter 6). Kindling can then take place in this nest box. Kindling can
take place at any time of the day but morning seems to be the most
popular time. All she needs now is rest and feed. A scared doe may eat
her young. Cannibalism may occur for other reasons too, such as no
drinking water, lack of minerals and sometimes for no apparent reason.
However, unrest is likely to be a main cause. If a doe, especially
after the second litter, keeps eating or biting her young it is better to
kill her and eliminate this bad characteristic. Most does, however,
have no problems and distinguish easily between the newly born
18 Reproduction
young and the afterbirth: they lick the first and eat the second, although
smell and taste can not be so different.</p>
                <p>Do not handle the kindles more than is absolutely necessary, but check
the newborn trying not to disturb them too much. Wash your hands
first, as the smell of dogs, cats or rodents may upset the mother. Check
the kindles for full bellies and for dead ones. The smell of the nest will
soon tell you if it is dirty. Does with diarrhoea cause a distinct smell.</p>
                <p>The doe does not take care of her kindles is a common complaint
from beginners. In fact the doe only allows her kindles to suckle one
or two times a day, and even then only for a short period. So the doe
will rarely be seen with the kindles. Do not worry too much!</p>
                <p>The hutch/cage should be large enough for the nest box and leaving
space for the doe. If it is too small she might accidentally hurt the kindles
by sitting on them.</p>
                <p>After two weeks they will start to come out of the box, depending on
the size of the box, the amount of milk the mother has and other factors
such as the temperature in the box. After about 3 weeks the nest
box can easily be removed. If the floor of the maternity cage is of wire
or has big holes which make it difficult for the kindles to put their feet
down, give them a piece of plywood or something similar in a corner
so they can sit easily. At this time they will also suckle (or seem to)
more often in a day.</p>
                <p>Weaning usually takes place after about 4 weeks but should not be
later than 6 weeks. Milk production seems to stop at that time, so there
is no use for the young being with the mother any longer.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
            <h2>4.6  When to mate the doe again</h2>
                <p>Like rats, the rabbit can be mated the very day of kindling and she is
likely to become pregnant. However, results might be disappointing.
The litters will be smaller, lighter and with a higher rate of mortality,
Reproduction 19
not forgetting the stress on the mother, being pregnant and lactating at
the same time. Even where feeding and other conditions are optimal it
is common to mate again only after 3-4 weeks. In backyard farming
practice feeding can be assumed to be less than very good. Therefore
giving the doe more time between matings (10-12 weeks) will probably
be better and result in larger and healthier (although fewer) litters.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the doe will not accept the buck right after weaning, it may
take quite a few days (weeks) to get her willing. What can you do?
Just wait and keep trying to mate! Willingness seems less of a problem
right after birth or during lactation than later on around or after weaning!</p>
                <p>One more thing: there are advantages in mating two does at the time,
if one of them does refuse to suckle the kindles or dies or whatever,
you always have a foster mother at hand.</p>

                <h1>Favourable Microclimate</h1>
                    <p>Much has been said about rain, temperature, wind and sunshine when
discussing the stable. By now, you will know what is desirable and
what is harmful. For a hutch there are many more building materials
which can be used. You can work with plastic, bamboo mats, corrugated
iron, cardboard, wood etc. Even though some materials will not
last long, they require little investment for the small farmer.
Remember: fresh air is necessary; draught is harmful; direct sunlight
is unnecessary; a more or less stable temperature is best.</p>
                </div>
                    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false">
                    <h2>Protection from Predictors</h2>
                        <p>Predators are probably the most important matter. Too often rats, cats
or dogs scare the rabbits by walking over the cage. They will eat
young rabbits if they manage to enter the cage. Even if they do not
enter the cage, the does may be so scared that they even eat their own
young.</p>
                        <p>To make a cage rat-proof is very difficult but especially useful for the
maternity cages. A rat will not easily attack a litter of 4-week old rabbits.
You can use either wire, bamboo, wood, (galvanized) iron sheets
according to availability and price (iron material has the definite disadvantage
of rusty pieces falling off and hurting the animals either by
cuts and wounds or after they have accidentally eaten it). Bamboo is
not readily chewed upon by rats or rabbits (especially the hard side)
but they do get through.</p>
                        <p>For the sake of hygiene the hard outside of the bamboo is best to be
placed to the inside of the cage so that it is easier to clean (figure 11).
This means that the soft side is left to the rat to eat from outside.
Regular inspection is necessary, rats get through small holes, and once
they smell blood.
If you place the bamboo splits close together no rat will get in but neither
will light and fresh air get in, so sometimes wire may be better.
Once again, especially poor quality wire, (common in the tropics) is
not ideal for animal housing.</p>
                        <p>Another predator can be ants which reportedly can feast on a newborn
litter. The only solution is to put the legs of the cage in cans filled with
oil or kerosene.</p>

                        <p>Handling must be easy, this means that the door should open easily,
cleaning must be easy (see next section on hygiene), the rabbit can be
seen easily without having to open the cage, feeding should be easy,
cleaning of feed and drinking water equipment should be easy, etc.</p>
                        <div data-role="collapsible">
                        <h2>Doors</h2>
                            <p>Besides swing hinges one can use a variety of other door designs such
as the loose door (figure 12).
A door opening all cages at once is a possibility either as a loose frame
or using hinges (figure 13).</p>
                            <p>If the doors swing sideways they will usually disturb the door of the
neighbours cage, especially if feeder troughs are at the outside. If you
do not like the loose type, the upswinging type is probably the most
32 Housing: the individual hutches
convenient. Another type is the door which opens from the top, but
this is only practical if the cage does not have to be cleaned (pellet
feeding on a wire cage).

            <h2>Water requirements</h2>
                <p>Before we deal with feeding requirements, let us first have a look at
the need for water. Water is not considered a nutrient. But this does
not mean that the rabbit does not need water. Many people claim, that
a rabbit does not need drinking water, because food like grass, cassava
leaves or sweet potato tubers contain water already. Indeed in quite a
few places rabbits do not regularly receive drinking water and still
others never receive drinking water but they still reproduce, grow and
seem to go unharmed. In fact, it may be difficult to get those animals
used to drinking water. But general advice has to be: give them clean
water. They may do without, but they will do better with water. Expense
is nil; work of course is added and sometimes the water gets
dirty and starts to smell. With proper care and equipment, clean water

should, and can become a routine. In figure 23 some drinking equipment
designs are given.</p>

                <h2>Feed</h2>
                    <p>Proper feeding will influence the rabbits growth, fertility and health.
Some foodstuffs contain a lot of protein (especially fresh greens),
some are sources of energy (like ricebran, tubers, etc). Both protein
and energy, as well as minerals are of importance.</p>
                    <p>To start with, a rabbit will benefit from greens. These are grass, leaves,
vegetables, etc. Watch out for possible poisoning like from cassava
leaves or other plants. Usually the local population is aware of which
plants are poisonous. But leaves or grass are not all the same. Young
(4-weeks old) grass is easier to digest and contains almost twice as
much protein as 8-weeks old grass. Leaves are much more nutritious
than stems. Try to find grass with a lot of leaves therefore. However
succulent the stem may seem, feeding value is low generally.</p>
                    <p>It is also possible to feed rabbits left-overs from the kitchen
or the local restaurant.</p>
                    <p>Just like humans, rabbits also need variety in their diet. It is better to
add something starchy (contains much energy) to their feed. Good
candidates for this are: ricebran, (cassava) tubers, waste carrots, corn
(expensive!), rice left over from the kitchen.</p>
                    <p>The amount of feed to give a rabbit depends very much on the state of
production. A lactating mother needs a lot of concentrate feed (grain,
tubers) besides greens, to maintain her bodyweight and produce milk
for her young. Young rabbits also need some concentrated feed for
growing, as we have seen recently in a simple experiment. We had
four groups of six animals each, that were just weaned. One group
received grass only (of doubtful quality) and all the rabbits died. The
other 3 groups received supplements and none died. It may pay to give
sick animals some commercial pelleted broiler or chicken feed. If you
feed meal it is better to moisten this a little bit, otherwise the rabbit
will not eat it.</p>
                    <p>Apart from energy and protein, minerals are also an important ingredient
in the diet. Greens and concentrates contain a lot of minerals. Nevertheless
it is advisable to add some minerals in the form of salt to the
food. For example, when feeding ricebran, one spoon of salt mixed
with 1 kg of bran will be sufficient.</p>

                <h2>Growth Rate of Rabbit</h2>
                    <p>It is a good idea to weigh your animals regularly (for example every
week). By measuring growth you have a much better idea of the well
being of your animals than by visual observation only. Growth rates of
around 15-20 grams per day are common in the tropics even though it
is possible to obtain 30-40 grams per day on very good food. Dont

forget that the animal reaches highest growth rates in the first months.
After becoming mature the body weight will remain constant. So if
your animals start growing less, besides diseases or bad feed, age
might be the factor!</p>
                    <p>Do not feed for the fastest growth but try to find a balance between
growth and general health, perfect feed and less than perfect feed.
Even though rabbits may subsist on greens alone, young growing
animals and does especially need supplements with preferably some
grain (corn, ricebran), to stay healthy, grow and reproduce.</p>
