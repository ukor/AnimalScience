        <p>The introduction of semi-intensive and intensive methods, modeled on those successfully employed for beef and dairy production in agriculturally advanced countries, is largely confined to government, parastatals and institutional research farms. They commenced with the establishment of a number of governments Livestock Improvement and Breeding Centres (LIBC) in different parts of the country during the late 1940’s and early 1950s. This trend continued into the 1960s and has attracted the attention of some farmers in the private sector, who, in corporative groups or as individuals have started mixed farming enterprises. These mixed farming operations have gained popularity amongst the educated groups (retired public servants, etc) who are taking advantage of the Federal Government’s encouragement of agricultural production through the provision of guaranteed credit facilities. Though initially influenced by Fulani systems cattle production on these units has some element of specialization into <b><i>beef</i></b>  and <strong><i>milk</i></strong> production whereas in the traditional system, both are complementary products of the cattle industry.</p>
        <dl>
        <dt>1.	Beef Production: </dt>
            <dd>The establishment of beef cattle ranches has taken place mainly in the Guinea Savanna zones. The ranches are stocked with indigenous cattle breeds such as the Gudali (Sokoto and Adamawa), the Bunaji, and in the ore southerly areas the trypanotolerant N’Dama has been introduced along with the Ketuku or Borgawa cattle. Management plans on most ranches have included provision of extensive range grazing, sometimes undersown with legumes, with allocations of 3 – 4 hectares/animal in the Southern Guinea to 4 – 6 hectares/animal in the Northern Guinea and Sudan Savanna zones. Some of the ranches provide improved pasture areas of about 0.125 ha/animal for dry season feeding (Upper Ogun Ranch in Oyo State) or maize and grass silage also for dry season feeding and feed lot operations (Mokwa Ranch, Niger State). Mineral salt licks are provided in the paddocks and all year round watering from dams and bore holes. Deworming and vaccination against the major cattle diseases are carried out routinely, and cattle dips are provided for control of ectoparasites, particularly ticks, some recording has been carried out but because of the inconsistency with which this has been done, it has not been very easy to utilize these records in a meaningful evaluation of technical and economic performances. A ‘Steer Fattening Unit’ scheme was introduced for small-scale producers in the Derived Savanna areas of the old Western Region in which, under a system of continuous bush grazing with adequate water supply, mineral salt licks and facilities for tick control and deworming possibility of profitable beef production using trypanotolerant breeds and crosses was investigated. This idea caught on with many farmers in the area, and has continued with modified aspects of the scheme and today a good number of them fattern steers for supply to slaughter houses in Ibadan and other urban areas. A recent apparently successful development along these lines is the Smallholder Fattening Scheme introduced by the World Bank Assisted Livestock Project Unit (LPU). Feed lot fattening of yearling bulls steers on a commercial scale was introduced into the Nigerian beef industry about a decade ago on the Mokwa Cattle Ranch. A significant development was the introduction of sugarcane molasses from the Bacita Sugar Factory into the fattening diet in late 1972. The fattening programme was planned to coincide with the end of the sugar cane harvesting season, so that large quantities of molasses would become available for feeding during the long dry season period of November to April. The bulls and steers were purchased from the traditional herds as yearlings aged 18 – 24 months, predominantly Sokoto Gudalis with some Bunajis with average weights of 200 – 240 kg. They were quarantined for 30 days during which they were vaccinated for CBPP, anthrax, and proplylactic treatment with ‘Berenil’ against trypanosomiasis, as well as drenching for worms and spraying for ectoparasites. Therefore, they entered the feedlots with two-week adaptation period on the molasses based feeding regime. Group fed, each animal received approximately 3 kg molasses, 3 kg cottonseed, 5kg grass/maize silage plusad libitum supply of salt licks and water. Over a- three-month fattening period, the animals average 300 kg live weight at average, daily gains 682 gm. The dressed carcasses were marketed through the cold stores and supermarkets in urban centres of Lagos and Ibadan  

Although the records indicate substantial improvements in the physical performance of the indigenous breeds under the modern as compared to the traditional system of management, it is pertinent to note that the different models of the modern sector taken together only account for a very small percentage of the National Herd and their contributions to the beef market is therefore correspondingly small.
</dd>
    <dt>2.	Milk Production:</dt>
            <dd>Milk production under the system of management is confined almost exclusively to government or institutional experimental farms. The dairies are generally located within easy marketing distance of consumption centres, and attempts have been made to organize dairying countries. Herd size varies from 30 to 50 on the experimental stations and from 50 to 200 on the ‘urban’ dairies operated by various State Ministries of Agriculture. The animals are housed, milked by hand and/or machine, and the milk is usually processed before distribution to consumers. The animals are maintained on cultivated pastures with supplementary concentrates, and standard milk recording is practiced on most farms. Although milk production per animal under the modern system has been substantially higher than that obtained by traditional producers, the results have not been very encouraging when compared with their counterparts elsewhere. Low performances have been attributed to poor management resulting in low pregnancy rates due to poor organization of the breeding programme especially heat detection for Al, long calving intervals, short lactations, and little attention to balanced feeding in terms of concentrate or forage use. In addition, there tended to be very little selection of stock at the time of purchase. In terms of increased milk production in their own right, the contribution of these dairies has been insignificant and they have incurred high costs and considerable manpower demands. Although it could be argued that their role is as research and development centres, this could be justified if their breeding and production objectives are carefully defined and satisfactorily implemented along with the generation of records from which objectives evaluation of performance can be made; in most cases this has been the case.
